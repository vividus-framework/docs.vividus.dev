is an open-source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid, and mobile web apps. It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. Learn more. You can run VIVIDUS automated scenarios on mobile devices using Appium tool. Since Appium has a Client/Server Architecture, it is required to install and run Appium server to perform mobile tests. There are two ways of installing Appium server: Application installation (Appium Desktop) Appium Desktop is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any platform. It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server, so you don’t need to worry about Node. Download the latest version of Appium Desktop. Command line installation Appium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed from source or installed directly from NPM: npm install -g appium To run Appium use the command: appium Make sure you have installed: Java Android SDK Xcode (iOS) And the following environment variables are set: JAVA_HOME ANDROID_HOME You can open \"Edit configuration\" to set the variables in Appium Desktop. Read more details for basic Android and iOS setup in Appium Guide. Appium-Doctor diagnoses, reports and fixes common Node, iOS and Android configuration issues before starting Appium. It helps to make sure you have everything to start using Appium. Appium-doctor checks for: Android: Android sdk exists and configured properly; Environment variables and path check; iOS: XCode is installed (with command line tools); Dev tools security check; Auth check; Node binary check; Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and values that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that tell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required capabilities for any Appium driver should include: platformName: the name of the platform to automate platformVersion: the version of the platform to automate deviceName: the kind of device to automate app: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the browserName capability instead in the case of automating a web browser) automationName: the name of the driver you wish to use There are lots of other capabilities. To find out more please see Appium Capabilities Documentation. Before running VIVIDUS scenarios it is necessary to pass Desired Capabilities to Appium Server. Use them as properties with selenium.grid.capabilities. prefix. Then just put these capabilities into the appropriate *.properties file. Please see examples below: Example 1. iOS properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=15.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.ipa Example 2. Android properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=11.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=Pixel 6 selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=UIAutomator2 selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.apk While Android devices require only one additional property, for iOS you need to set three more. See the relevant sections for defining these properties for iOS and Android Appium Inspector is basically just an Appium client with a user interface. It allows to interact with application elements and Appium commands in a user friendly way. You can get the latest version of Inspector application following the link. Click to view capabilities set up in Inspector VIVIDUS Sample Tests is a GitHub repository. Its purpose is to demo VIVIDUS capabilities via sample tests. Let’s use it as an example for running mobile tests via Appium. Assumptions You have installed and properly set up the following: IDE Appium Server AVD Manager (Android) Simulator application (iOS) Cloning and importing the repository Clone vividus-sample-tests project using the following command: git clone --recursive git@github.com:vividus-framework/vividus-sample-tests.git Then use this detailed guide to proceed with importing and building the project. Overriding properties Since we are only interested in the mobile application story, add the following properties to the overriding.properties file. Choose one of the platforms and make sure properties match with your simulator set up. Click to expand overriding.properties Example 3. Minimum iOS setup selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=1.20.2 selenium.grid.url=http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub configuration.profiles=mobile_app/ios configuration.suites=mobile_app/ios configuration.environments= selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest Example 4.

Click to view screenshots Appium-Desktop Appium in the terminal Tests execution and expected results Execute the test either via ./gradlew runStories command or by clicking the Run button in the IDE. In case everything has been set up correctly you will see the following: Appium creates a new session; Testing application (Swag Labs Mobile) is installed on the simulator; Application is started; Credentials are entered into username and password fields; After successful login user sees the landing page; Executing tests on real devices has some features and required different preparations depending on the platform. Firstly, make sure you have installed Android Debug Bridge. Simply enter in the command line adb --version. You should get some adb information in the output: adb --version Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 Version 31.0.3-7562133 Installed as /usr/local/bin/adb Connect the device you want to interact with to your workstation. Use adb devices command to see the list of connected devices: adb devices List of devices attached UKjeCe9Mr9 device In this example UKjeCe9Mr9 is the unique identifier of the device. Use that number as a udid capability (property) in VIVIDUS: selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=UKjeCe9Mr9 You are ready to run tests! Just add this property to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Emulators Automating a real device with XCUITest Driver(iOS) is considerably more complicated, due to Apple’s restrictions around running apps on real devices. XCUITest driver installs a helper application called WebDriverAgent-Runner onto the device, and handles the application under test via it. While this is simple in theory, the hoops of code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can make this a bit of a headache. There are two approaches for WebDriverAgent configuration: Automatic WDA configuration. Proper work of the WDA requires signing it with a valid Apple Developer account. If you have a paid Apple Developer account, please see the following instructions on Appium Doc; Manual WDA configuration. Using a \"Free\" developer account often leads to issues with the impossibility of creating a wildcard provisioning profile for the default application bundle. Follow the instructions below to handle this issue. The next steps are based on Appium manual configuration doc. Add a new Apple Development Certificate for your Apple ID; Click to see details Open Xcode and go to settings Click \"+\" to add an account and then Sign In with your Apple ID Add a new Apple Development Certificate Build WebDriverAgent signed with your newly created certificate; Open WDA project in Xcode; Most common path to the project: /Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj Come up with your unique Bundle Identifier. Use it for updating build parameters. Click to see details Make sure you’ve chosen correct device and parameters image::appium-check-device-and-parameters.png[] Create your unique BundleId and update build parameters image::appium-update-build-parameters.png[] Build the project Click to see details # iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeSigningId=Apple Development(1) selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=b3f34105281bb345p980p824401d5913f13efe81(2) selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeOrgId=5H8S64Q9G4(3) selenium.grid.capabilities.updatedWDABundleId=yourUniqueBundleId.WebDriverAgentRunner(4) 1 xcodeSigningId For any Apple device use Apple Development as the xcodeSigningId property. 2 UDID Make sure your Apple device is connected; Open Finder and choose your device; Copy udid from the device information; Click to view screenshots 3 xcodeOrgId Open KeyChain Access application; Go to Default Keychains → Login; Open My Certificates tab and find certificated you have created recently; Open Certificate and use Organisational Unit parameter as xcodeOrgId property; Click to view screenshots 4 updatedWDABundleId Use your unique Bundle Identifier that was created previously as updatedWDABundleId property; When all tools are installed and set up and all desired capabilities are defined, we can start our tests. For the first time, Appium will install the WDA application on the Apple device. Since WDA is signed with an unknown Apple Developer account, we need to add it to the trust. Start the session either via Appium Inspector or by running an autotest. Once the WDA icon appears on the screen, do the following: Go to Settings→General→Profile & Device Management (iOS 15 and higher - Settings→General→VPN & Device Management); Tap on \"Apple Development: \"account name\"; Choose \"Trust\"; Click to view screenshot You are ready to run tests! Just add properties from above to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Simulators Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Make sure adb sees the device (adb devices). In case the device is not on the list, try restarting adb server via terminal: adb kill-server && \\ adb start-server WDA is expired. This is the most common issue that appeared on iOS devices Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65 When it happens, the icon of the WebDriverAgent disappears from the device menu. To get it back on the device you should rebuild WDA for your device and add your developer account to trust again; Use this guide to fix WDA expiration much faster Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Yes. You can create the second application signed with your Apple Developer account. Once WebDriverAgent get expired, it will be deleted. But your second app will remain on the device and keep your Apple Developer account in the trusted list. You will only need to rebuild WDA in a click to get it back. Click to expand steps Make sure your device is connected to your workstation; Open Xcode and create a new project; Choose Application type \"App\" for your platform; Enter Product Name, let’s say \"keeper\"; Use the same Team and Organization Identifier that you used for WebDriverAgent; Click Build; Now your mobile device has the keeper application installed. It will remain on the device even when WDA is deleted due to expiration. When it happens, just connect the device, open the WDA project and click build. After the build is successful you can start your Appium sessions again. Make sure your computer and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-FI network.; On Apple TV go to Settings→Remotes and Devices→Remote App and Devices; On your Mac open Xcode→Window→Devices and Simulators (⌘+2); Click \" + \" on the tab \"Devices\" to add a new device.; Choose your Apple TV from the list; Enter the 6-digit passcode that appeared on the TV screen;","title":"Appium Setup","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"appium-setup","url":"/vividus/latest/user-guides/appium-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Intro","hash":"_intro","id":1},{"text":"Install Appium server","hash":"_install_appium_server","id":2},{"text":"Environment setup","hash":"_environment_setup","id":3},{"text":"Appium-Doctor (Optional)","hash":"_appium_doctor_optional","id":4},{"text":"Appium Capabilities","hash":"_appium_capabilities","id":5},{"text":"Setting capabilities in VIVIDUS","hash":"_setting_capabilities_in_vividus","id":6},{"text":"Basic properties","hash":"_basic_properties","id":7},{"text":"Real devices properties","hash":"_real_devices_properties","id":8},{"text":"Appium Inspector (Optional)","hash":"_appium_inspector_optional","id":9},{"text":"Running tests on Simulator/Emulator","hash":"_running_tests_on_simulatoremulator","id":10},{"text":"Running tests on Real Devices","hash":"_running_tests_on_real_devices","id":11},{"text":"Android","hash":"_android","id":12},{"text":"Android device UDID","hash":"_android_device_udid","id":13},{"text":"iOS","hash":"_ios","id":14},{"text":"WDA configuration","hash":"_wda_configuration","id":15},{"text":"Manual WDA configuration","hash":"_manual_wda_configuration","id":16},{"text":"Define properties for running a real apple device","hash":"_define_properties_for_running_a_real_apple_device","id":17},{"text":"First start","hash":"_first_start","id":18},{"text":"F.A.Q.","hash":"_f_a_q","id":19},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an Android device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_android_device","id":20},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an iOS device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_ios_device","id":21},{"text":"It’s quite unhandy to add an Apple Developer account to trusted every time WDA is expired.

ExamplesTable represents a tabular structure that holds rows of example data for parameters named via the column headers: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| Rows starting with an ignorable separator (defaults to |--) are allowed and ignored: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |-- A commented row --| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |-- Another commented row --| |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The separators are also configurable via inlined properties: {ignorableSeparator=!--,headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!} !header 1!header 2! .... !header n! !-- A commented row --! !value 11!value 12! .... !value 1n! ... !-- Another commented row --! !value m1!value m2! .... !value mn! Comments in column values are supported via the commentSeparator inlined property: {commentSeparator=#} | header 1#comment | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11#comment | value 12 | .... | value 1n | Comments including the separator are stripped. By default all column values are trimmed. To avoid trimming the values, use the trim inlined property: {trim=false} | header 1 | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11 | value 12 | .... | value 1n | By default, all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However, it might be required to map certain values to null-s. This can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| Line break is a default separator for rows in ExamplesTable, that’s why they can’t be added as is to the data. In order to put value with line breaks to ExamplesTable escape sequences (a character preceded by a backslash \\ is an escape sequence) must be used. Escape Sequence Description \\n Insert a newline in the value at this point. \\r Insert a carriage return in the text at this point. \\\\ Insert a backslash character in the text at this point. The inlined property processEscapeSequences defines whether escape sequences should be replaced in the data. It’s false by default (no property is declared explicitly). The allowed values are true and false, any other values are considered invalid and will lead to parsing error. {processEscapeSequences=true, commentSeparator=#} |header | |line 1\\nline 2 |# The value with a newline |line 1\\r\\nline 2|# The value with a carriage return and a newline |line 1\\\\nline 2 |# The value with an escaped escape sequence, the result will be \"line 1\\nline 2\" Synonyms: VIVIDUS expression. An expression is a special placeholder which is detected, evaluated and resolved during test execution. Expressions are used for the data generation and transformation. General expression syntax is: #{expression} During resolution process the expression placeholder is replaced with the result of the expression evaluation. If expression is unknown for VIVIDUS, the placeholder will be kept as is. If expression evaluation results in error, it will be propagated to the top level and the test will be marked as broken. Expression accepts 1 or more arguments as input parameters. It’s allowed to construct nested expressions: in this case the evaluation starts with the deepest expression. Expressions may include any number of variables placeholders. Expressions accepting exactly 1 argument process it as is: all leading and trailing spaces are preserved no symbols are changed or removed Expression Resulting argument #{expression(x)} x #{expression( x )} x #{expression( x, y, z )} x, y, z #{expression( x\\, y\\, z )} x\\, y\\, z #{expression(\"\"\" x, y, z \"\"\")} \"\"\" x, y, z \"\"\" The rules used for processing of expressions accepting more than 1 argument are following: comma , is a delimiter for arguments Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x,y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression(x:a,y;b,z)} argument 1: x:a argument 2: y;b argument 3: z #{expression(x,)} argument 1: x argument 2: all leading and trailing argument spaces are trimmed Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x, y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression( x , y , z )} argument 1: x argument 2: y argument 3: z #{expression( x , )} argument 1: x argument 2: meaningful commas (not used as delimiters) can be added to arguments in 2 ways: escape comma using backslash \\ Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x\\,a, y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x \\, a , y\\,b , )} argument 1: x , a argument 2: y,b argument 3: wrap argument into triple quotes (it might be convenient when arguments are get dynamically (e.g. from HTTP response) and escaping of such values could be a bit complicated) The leading and trailing spaces outside triple quotes are trimmed, but the leading and trailing spaces inside triple quotes are preserved.

A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExamplesTable transformer. ExamplesTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\. Example 1. Escaping special characters in transformer properties {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER, countries=\\{Australia\\,Canada\\}} In the example above the transformer will have a single property with name countries and value {Australia,Canada}. VIVIDUS variables of scopes global and next batches can be used in transformer properties (pay attention to escapes of the variables placeholders in the example below). Example 2.

Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued. The following properties are used to configure batches (VIVIDUS doesn’t provide any default batch configuration out of the box). batch-number is one-based batch index. The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property Default value Description batch-.resource-location The test project path to the folder with story-files batch-.resource-include-patterns */.story The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be included in the batch.

Overrides value specified via story.execution-timeout. batch.fail-fast false If set to true the subsequent batches execution will be stopped after the first failed batch story.fail-fast false If set to true the story execution will be stopped after the first failed scenario scenario.fail-fast false If set to true the scenario execution will be stopped after the first failed assertion story.execution-timeout PT2H The max duration of the single story in ISO-8601 Durations format. Could be overriden via corresponging batch setting. bdd.configuration.dry-run false Enables dry-run execution mode (no actual steps will be executed, dynamic variables and expressions won’t be resolved). For example dry-run could be useful to debug what stroies will be executed with provided config. bdd.configuration.skip-story-if-given-story-failed false Skips the story in case of failure in the given story bdd.configuration.formats JSON,XML Available formats of the output files with test execution results statistics.print-failures false If set to true prints table of failures including: story, scenario, step and error message report.text-length-diff-threshold 100 Defines text threshold length to enable unified diff report publishing on failure, for variable comparisons. If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. engine.composite-paths Paths to the composite steps e.g. steps/*.steps A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question \"What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?\". These specifics (properties) should be written in the profile.properties file. Path to this file is set in configuration.properties file: Example 2. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=web It’s allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones. Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into profile.properties files in appropriate places. Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution. Let’s create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let’s see profiles structure for this case: └─ src/main/resources/properties └─ profile (1) ├─ web (2) ├─ chrome (4) └─ profile.properties (6) ├─ firefox (4) └─ profile.properties └─ profile.properties (5) ├─ mobile_app (2) ├─ iOS (7) └─ profile.properties ├─ android (7) └─ profile.properties (9) └─ profile.properties (8) └─ profile.properties (3) 1 Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties; 2 General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device; 3 The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device; 4 Web browsers' profiles (directories); 5 Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles; 6 Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices; 7 Mobile profiles (directories); 8 Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only; 9 Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup; By default, profile property is pointed to the /src/main/resources/properties/profile directory, so use the relative path starting from profile when you have nested directories: Example 3. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android Some of the plugins, like web-app, have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers. Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration. Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into environment.properties file. The path to this file is set in configuration.properties file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them: Example 4. configuration.properties configuration.environments=dev #configuration.environments=test #configuration.environments=prod Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the same approach of reusing and separating values. Configuration set simplifies reusage of pre-defined combinations of profiles/suites/environments. Users are allowed to define multiple configuration sets. Only one configuration set can be used during a test run. Example 5. Configuration sets definition configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.profiles= configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.suites=uat configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.environments=preprod configuration-set.api-test-regression.profiles= configuration-set.api-test-regression.suites=regression configuration-set.api-test-regression.environments=test Once configuration sets are defined, one can use an active configuration set for test execution. Example 6. Usage of configuration set configuration-set.active=api-preprod-uat Configuration sets can be defined only in configuration.properties file. Active configuration set overrides defined configuration.profiles, configuration.suites and configuration.environments properties. Configuration set requires to define profiles, suites and environments, empty value considered as a valid one. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 7. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 8. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @priority 1 @layout desktop Given I am on page with URL `https://www.epam.com/` Then page title is equal to `EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting` Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @priority 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/` Then page title is equal to `Google` The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 9. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 10. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 11. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 12. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @layout desktop, phone, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 13. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 14. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests. GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues. AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all. RED 3 Test report isn’t generated. Common errors: \"InvalidConfigurationException: No batches with tests to execute are configured\" - the configured suite has 0 batches, i.e. no tests to execute are configured. RED Here one could find description of general HTTP properties applied across all the HTTP interactions in VIVIDUS.

Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value variables.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.variables.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.variables.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle.

I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I’ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I’ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them…​ but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it…​ ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love…​ And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man…​ A man that made me remember the Fifth of November. A man that I will never forget.

Zelda.character Cucco Keeper Zelda.game Zelda II: Adventure of Link Zodiac.sign Gemini Let’s see the structure of the expression for the following example: #{generate(Internet.password '5', '10', 'true')} #{generate (1) (Internet (2) .password (3) '5', (4) '10', (4) 'true')} (4) 1 Generate expression itself. 2 Data provider from the list. In this case - Internet. Click on its name to see the methods it contains. 3 One of the available methods within Internet data provider - password. There are multiple choices, we picked the fourth one. 4 Available arguments for the chosen method. There are three of them: int minimumLength - minimum number of symbols; int maximumLength - maximum number of symbols; boolean includeUppercase - true or false for Uppercase usage; In this way we created an expression that generates a password from 5 to 10 characters length including uppercase letters.

Usage of FROM_LANDSCAPE transformer {transformer=FROM_LANDSCAPE} |header 1|value 11| ... | value m1| ... |header n|value 1n| .... |value mn| RESOLVING_EXPRESSIONS_EAGERLY transformer processes expressions which are used inside ExamplesTable eagerly, i.e. at the table loading stage. If expressions generating random data are used in the table with RESOLVING_EXPRESSIONS_EAGERLY transfomer, the random data will be generated once and each placeholder will be replaced with this value. While in regular flow placeholders are replaced with the expression and data is generated at step execution stage, in other words the same placeholders will be replaced by different randomly generated datasets. Example 2. Usage of RESOLVING_EXPRESSIONS_EAGERLY transformer {transformer=RESOLVING_EXPRESSIONS_EAGERLY} |firstName |lastName | |#{generate(Address.firstName)}|#{generate(Address.lastName)}| RESOLVING_SELF_REFERENCES_EAGERLY transformer enables eagerly resolution of references to one column from another column within single ExamplesTable (\"eagerly\" means at the table loading stage).

By default - ASCENDING. sortingTypes the optional sorting types ordered according to the column names from the byColumns parameter: STRING or NUMBER (only for number values). By default - STRING. The sorting types are joined using | (if one sorting type is defined, it applies to all column names from the byColumns parameter) Example 6. Usage of SORTING transformer with DESCENDING sorting and sorting type by default (STRING). The following transformer: {transformer=SORTING, byColumns=key1|key2, order=DESCENDING} |key1|key2|key3| |bb |d |1 | |ba |c |2 | |bb |b |3 | |aa |a |4 | will result in the following ExamplesTable: |key1|key2|key3| |bb |d |1 | |bb |b |3 | |ba |c |2 | |aa |a |4 | Example 7.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story. Variables are invalidated once the story is completed. next_batches Variables are available in the next batches. next_batches-scoped variable is not available in batch it’s declared within. batch Such variables are declared only with batch-.variables. prefix and available throughout the execution of the batch in the suite. An attempt to create the batch-scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 1. Declaring batch variable locale batch-1.variables.locale=/us/en/ batch-2.variables.locale=/uk/en/ Example 2. Using batch variable locale Given I am on main application page When I go to the relative URL '${locale}' global Such variables are declared only via properties with variables. prefix and available throughout the entire execution. An attempt to create the globally scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 3. Declaring global variable login-endpoint variables.login-endpoint=https://my-auth-server.com/api/login Example 4. Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `${login-endpoint}` Then response code is equal to `200` It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 5. Declaring global variable with expression random-user variables.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 6. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `/authenticate` Then response code is equal to `200` Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, batch-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 7. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario Given I initialize scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` Given I initialize story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario. Reference to uninitialized variable can be resolved to default value using the operator : (colon). Table 1. Examples of using default values Reference to resolve Variable value Output ${var:default} value value ${var:default} default ${var:} ${var:default:with:colons} default:with:colons ${var[0]:default} default ${var[0].key:default} default ${var:#{generate(DungeonsAndDragons.alignments)}} Chaotic Evil ${var:${var1}} var - , var1 - value value ${var:${var1:}} var - , var1 - Example 8.

Values from list variables can be accessed by index. For example, ${listVar[0]} returns the first value. Values from map variables can be accessed by key. For instance, ${mapVar.key} returns the value associated with 'key'. VIVIDUS provides the ability to store tables in variables. Tables should have a header and at least one row with values. Table 2. Assuming we have the table below stored in the variable 'tableVar': A B A1 B1 A2 B2 To access specific cell values, specify the row and header key. Rows indexing starts from 0. * ${tableVar[0].A} returns the value from the first row of column A: A1. * ${tableVar[1].B} returns the value from the second row of column B: B2.","title":"Variables","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"variables","url":"/vividus/latest/commons/variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution","id":1},{"text":"Regular variables","hash":"_regular_variables","id":2},{"text":"Scopes","hash":"_scopes","id":3},{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution_2","id":4},{"text":"Default values","hash":"_default_values","id":5},{"text":"Complex types variables","hash":"_complex_types_variables","id":6},{"text":"Accessing values","hash":"_accessing_values","id":7},{"text":"Working with tables","hash":"_working_with_tables","id":8}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Here one could find description of the steps that are delivered with Vividus itself without any plugins required.

Initialize variable with ExamplesTable using transformer When I initialize scenario variable `sitemapTransformerTable` with values: {transformer=FROM_SITEMAP, siteMapRelativeUrl=/index.html, column=sitemapUrl, ignoreErrors=true} Then `${sitemapTransformerTable[0].sitemapUrl}` is equal to `/index.html` Initializes a variable with a result of the processed Freemarker template Set the template-processor.resolve-bdd-variables property to true value to be able to use global, next batches, scenario and story variables within templates. The variables can be referred using the variable reference notation. Note that the parameters passed to the step take precedence over the variables. The vividus expressions can be used within templates by using ${execVividusExpression('expression name', args)} syntax. It’s also allowed to use nested expressions by using the following syntax ${execVividusExpression('expression name', arg1, execVividusExpression('expression name', args))}. Given I initialize $scopes variable `$variableName` using template `$templatePath` with parameters:$templateParameters $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store a result. $templatePath - The relative to src/main/resources path to a template. $templateParameters - The template parameters.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

Download S3 object When I fetch object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `my-json-var` Set the canned access control list (ACL) for the specified object in Amazon S3. Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for Java, which defines how a client may access a database. Every JDBC requires using specific driver. JDBC drivers are client-side adapters (installed on the client machine, not on the server) that convert requests from Java programs to a protocol that the database management system (DBMS) can understand. Copy the below line code to dependencies section of the project build.gradle file Example 1. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.6.1-SNAPSHOT') Define your JDBC driver and add appropriate dependency. Let’s take PostgreSQL as an example: Open JDBC page on maven repository; Find driver for your database and open details (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver); Choose and open version (42.5.4); Go to the Gradle tab and copy implementation string; Paste chosen dependency into your build.gradle file: Example 2. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.6.0') In case Maven repository does not contain driver you need, please refer to the documentation of your database to define suitable JDBC driver. If the project was imported to the IDE before adding new plugin, re-generate the configuration files for the used IDE and then refresh the project in the used IDE. For database interaction, you will need to set related properties. They have db.connection. prefix followed by the database connection name (vividus in the example). Come up with your own database name to use within the tests. Put properties into the environment.properties file: Example 3. environment.properties db.connection.vividus.url=jdbc:dbms://databaseUrl:port/databaseName?parameter1=true¶meter2=value (1) db.connection.vividus.username= (2) db.connection.vividus.password= (2) db.connection.vividus.driver-class-name=(3) 1 Database address. Consists of: jdbc: - reference to JDBC; dbms: - Database Management System, e.g. postgresql; //databaseUrl - address to your database; :port - port number, e.g. 5432; /databaseName - name of your database; parameters - any additional driver parameters you need to pass; URL structure slightly changes depending on the database management system. You can find templates for different DBMS in setup examples. 2 Credentials for given database connection; 3 Driver class name (Optional), e.g. org.postgresql.Driver. You might need it to specify the driver name for the exact database. Here are some examples of setting different databases connection for most popular DBMS-s.

Then JSON element value from `$json` by JSON path `$jsonPath` $comparisonRule `$expectedValue` $json - The JSON used to find JSON element value. $jsonPath - The JSON Path used to find JSON element value. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule to match JSON element value depending on the element type: for string - string comparison rules are applicable, for number - regular comparison rules are applicable, for boolean - only single rule IS_EQUAL_TO (readable form: is equal to) is allowed, for null - only two rules IS_EQUAL_TO and IS_NOT_EQUAL_TO (readable forms: is equal to and is not equal to) are allowed array and object are complex types and must be validated using another steps dedicated for JSON elements. $expectedValue - The expected value of JSON element to match according to the comparison rule. Example 16. Validate the price of the fourth book is greater than 22.50 When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/json-path/JsonPath/master/json-path-web-test/src/main/resources/webapp/json/goessner.json` Then JSON element value from `${response}` by JSON path `$.store.book[3].price` is greater than `22.50` Validates if the given JSON contains the expected JSON element matching the comparison rule by the specified JSON path. Then JSON element from `$json` by JSON path `$jsonPath` is equal to `$expectedData`$options json - The JSON used to find the actual JSON element. jsonPath - The JSON Path used to find the actual JSON element. expectedData - The expected JSON element to compare against. options - The set of JSON comparison options. Example 17. Validate JSON contains string value by JSON path Then JSON element from ` { \"accountId\": 12345, \"status\": \"Active\" } ` by JSON path `$.status` is equal to `\"Active\"` Validates the number of JSON elements found by the JSON path matches the expected number according to the specified comparison rule. Then number of JSON elements from `$json` by JSON path `$jsonPath` is $comparisonRule $elementsNumber json - The JSON used to find the actual JSON elements. jsonPath - The JSON Path used to find JSON elements. comparisonRule - The comparison rule. elementsNumber - The expected number of JSON elements. Example 18. Validate the number of accounts in JSON is equal to 2 Then number of JSON elements from ` [ { \"accountId\": 843 }, { \"accountId\": 233 } ] ` by JSON path `$..accountId` is equal to 2 Validates JSON against JSON Schema. Then JSON `$json` is valid against schema `$schema` $json - The JSON to validate. $schema - The JSON Schema. The step validates JSON according to schema specification version provided in the schema itself, e.g.: \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\" If the version is not present in the schema then JSON is validated according to 2020-12 version. Example 19. Validate product for sale information Then JSON ` { \"productId\": 1, \"productName\": \"A desk lamp\", \"price\": 12.50, \"tags\": [ \"lamp\", \"desk\" ] } ` is valid against schema ` { \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\", \"$id\": \"https://example.com/product.schema.json\", \"title\": \"Product\", \"description\": \"A product from catalog\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"productId\": { \"description\": \"The unique identifier for a product\", \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"productName\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"price\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"exclusiveMinimum\": 0 }, \"tags\": { \"description\": \"Tags for the product\", \"type\": \"array\", \"prefixItems\": [{ \"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"lamp\", \"desk\"] }], \"minItems\": 1, \"uniqueItems\": true } }, \"required\": [ \"productId\", \"productName\", \"price\", \"tags\" ] } ` Matcher is an object which compares objects against a specific criteria and returns a boolean value indicating whether the match was successful or not. Embedded matchers, placeholders and expressions can be found on the json-unit library readme. Validate if actual array contains any of entries from the expected one. #{json-unit.matches:anyOf}($input) $input - any string which represents expected array entries Example 20. Validate entries Given I initialize story variable `actual-json` with value ` { \"store\":{ \"authors\":[ { \"name\":\"Yakub Kolas\", \"available\":true }, { \"name\":\"Uladzimir Karatkevich\", \"available\":true } ] } } ` Then JSON element from `${actual-json}` by JSON path `$.store` is equal to `{\"book\":\"#{json-unit.matches:anyOf}[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Uladzimir Karatkevich\\\",\\\"available\\\":true},{\\\"author\\\":\\\"Yanka Kupala\\\",\\\"available\\\":true}])}\"` As JSON do not support multi line strings if you want to improve readability use escapeJson expression inside matcher Example 21. Validate entries with escapeJson expression Then JSON element from `${actual-json}` by JSON path `$.store` is equal to ` { \"book\":\"#{json-unit.matches:anyOf}#{escapeJson([ { \"name\":\"Uladzimir Karatkevich\", \"available\":true }, { \"author\":\"Yanka Kupala\", \"available\":true } ])}\" }","title":"JSON Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-json","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-json.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Dynamic variables","hash":"_dynamic_variables","id":2},{"text":"JSON context","hash":"_json_context","id":3},{"text":"Table Transformers","hash":"_table_transformers","id":4},{"text":"FROM_JSON","hash":"_from_json","id":5},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":6},{"text":"Save JSON element value","hash":"_save_json_element_value","id":7},{"text":"Save JSON element","hash":"_save_json_element","id":8},{"text":"Save number of JSON elements","hash":"_save_number_of_json_elements","id":9},{"text":"Convert JSON to variable","hash":"_convert_json_to_variable","id":10},{"text":"Patch JSON","hash":"_patch_json","id":11},{"text":"Execute steps on JSON elements","hash":"_execute_steps_on_json_elements","id":12},{"text":"Execute steps on JSON elements and exit on condition","hash":"_execute_steps_on_json_elements_and_exit_on_condition","id":13},{"text":"Validate JSON element value","hash":"_validate_json_element_value","id":14},{"text":"Validate JSON element","hash":"_validate_json_element","id":15},{"text":"Validate number of JSON elements","hash":"_validate_number_of_json_elements","id":16},{"text":"Validate JSON against schema","hash":"_validate_json_against_schema","id":17},{"text":"Matchers","hash":"_matchers","id":18},{"text":"Array contains any of entries","hash":"_array_contains_any_of_entries","id":19}]},"60":{"id":60,"text":"The plugin provides integration with continuous testing cloud LambdaTest.

Configure local execution of the tests for Android native application configuration.profiles=mobile_app/local2,mobile_app/android Gets the text of the system clipboard of simulator or real device Property Name Default Description mobile-environment.wda-bundle-id empty The property is for iOS real devices only and it specifies the WebDriverAgent bundle ID used to get clipboard text. The property value may vary depending on test cloud providers and can be found in the XCode logs. ${clipboard-text} Example 8. Verify clipboard content Then `${clipboard-text}` is equal to `uarlouski@gmail.com` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 9. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 10. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Given I start mobile application Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides globally-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilities have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 11. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 12. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 13. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 14. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Runs mobile application in the background for specific period of time and either activates the app after a certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated (when PT-1S is used). See Appium docs for more details. When I send mobile application to background for `$period` period $period - The period of time in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 15. Run app in background When I send mobile application to background for `PT5S` period Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(login-button)` is equal to `1` Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The settings to set. Example 16. Configure to show invisible elements When I change Appium session settings: |name |value| |allowInvisibleElements|true | Uploads a file to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 17. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image Upload the file with data to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file with name `$fileName` and data `$data` to device $data - The data to store as a file. $fileName - The name of the uploaded file. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 18. Upload the file with the image data to the device When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vividus-framework/vividus/master/vividus-tests/src/main/resources/baselines/context.png` When I upload file with name `context.png` and data `${response-as-bytes}` to device Then image is displayed in gallery Example 19. Upload the file with the text data to the device When I upload file with name `message.txt` and data `This is a message` to device Then message file is displayed in file explorer Deletes a file from the device/emulator/simulator. When I delete file `$filePath` from device Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be downloaded/deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to download/delete a file from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type for real devices is documents. Containers available for Simulators: app, data, groups, . If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a specially formatted path, which points to an item inside an app bundle, for example @my.app.id/my/path. It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format. /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle Example 20. Delete file When I delete file `/sdcard/Pictures/avatar.png` from device On iOS real device to add or delete photo or video to/from \"Camera Roll\" you need upload/delete photos or videos to/from /DCIM/100APPLE/ folder and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. Restart device is necessary after that. On iOS simulator to delete photo or video from \"Camera Roll\" you need to delete photo or video from /Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. And then restart simulator. Downloads the file from the device/emulator/simulator and saves its content to a variable. When I download file `$filePath` from device and save its content to $scopes variable `$variableName` Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be downloaded/deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to download/delete a file from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type for real devices is documents. Containers available for Simulators: app, data, groups, . If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a specially formatted path, which points to an item inside an app bundle, for example @my.app.id/my/path. It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format. /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the file content. Example 21. Download file When I download file `/sdcard/file.json` from device and save its content to scenario variable `json-file` Switches context to a web view with name that matches the rule (see Automating hybrid apps for more information). Also, Appium capabilities for iOS and Android are available for the fine-tuning configuration. When I switch to web view with name that $comparisonRule `$value` $comparisonRule - The web view name comparison rule. $value - The value to find the target web view. Example 22. Switch to web view by name Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I switch to web view with name that contains `vividustestapp` Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Switches context to a mobile native context. See Automating hybrid apps for more information. When I switch to native context Example 23. Switch to native context Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I switch to native context Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Taps on the element located by the locator. The atomic actions performed are: press on the element; release. When I tap on element located by `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 24. Tap on element When I tap on element located by `accessibilityId(menu-toggler)` Taps on the element located by the locator with the specified duration. The atomic actions performed are: press on the element; wait for the duration; release. When I tap on element located by `$locator` with duration `$duration` $locator - Locator. $duration - The duration between an element is pressed and released in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 25. Tap on element with duration When I tap on element located by `accessibilityId(menu-toggler)` with duration `PT0.5S` Performs double tap on the element located by the locator. The step is supported for Android and iOS platforms. When I double tap on element located by `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 26. Double tap on element When I double tap on element located by `accessibilityId(increment)` Presses iOS keys or Android keys. When I press $key key $key - The key to press. Example 27. Go to Home screen When I press Home key Performs long press of iOS keys or Android keys. to modify long press duration for iOS and tvOS you could use mobile-application.long-press-duration property. When I long press $key key $key - The key to perform long press action. Example 28. Go to Home screen When I long press Home key Presses a sequence of iOS keys or Android keys. When I press keys:$keys $keys - The keys to press. Example 29. Enter password When I press keys: |key| |P | |a | |s | |1 | |$ | Types the provided text All the characters will be treated as is and passed sequentially. To send special key like HOME please use Press keys. When I type text `$text` $text - The text to type. Example 30. Enter password When I type text `pas1$` Types the text into the element located by the locator. The existing text is re-written by the text passed into the step. The atomic actions performed are: type text into the element; hide keyboard. For iOS real devices the hide keyboard action works only for XCUIElementTypeTextField elements and skipped for XCUIElementTypeTextView elements, in case of XCUIElementTypeTextView element tap outside the text view is performed to close the keyboard. When I type `$text` in field located `$locator` $text - The text to type into the element. $locator - Locator. Example 31. Type text When I type `Bob` in field located `accessibilityId(username)` Only types text into the element. The keyboard hiding is skipped. When I type `$text` in field located `$locator` and keep keyboard opened $text - The text to type into the element. $locator - Locator. Example 32. Type text and keep keyboard opened When I type `Bob` in field located `accessibilityId(username)` and keep keyboard opened Clears the field located by the locator. The atomic actions performed are: clear the field; hide keyboard. For iOS real devices the hide keyboard action works only for XCUIElementTypeTextField elements and skipped for XCUIElementTypeTextView elements, in case of XCUIElementTypeTextView element tap outside the text view is performed to close the keyboard. When I clear field located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 33. Clear the field When I clear field located `accessibilityId(username)` Only clears the field located by the locator. The keyboard hiding is skipped. When I clear field located `$locator` and keep keyboard open $locator - Locator. Example 34. Clear text and keep keyboard open When I clear field located `accessibilityId(username)` and keep keyboard open Swipes to an element in either UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT direction with the specified swipe duration. The step takes into account the current context. If you need to perform swipe on the element, you need to switch the context to this element. mobile-application.swipe.limit - defines max numbers of swipes to perform (if it’s reached the swipe process is stopped and the error is thrown) mobile-application.swipe.stabilization-duration - defines a duration to wait after swipe until view becomes stable mobile-application.swipe.vertical.x-position - defines a vertical swipe x axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to x=1 and 100 corresponds to x = mobile screen width - 1, default value is 0 mobile-application.swipe.horizontal.y-position - defines a horizontal swipe y axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to y=1 and 100 corresponds to y = mobile screen height - 1, default value is 50 When I swipe $direction to element located by `$locator` with duration $swipeDuration $direction - The direction to swipe: UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. $locator - Locator. $swipeDuration - The swipe duration in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 35. Swipe to an element Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `0` When I swipe UP to element located by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `1` Example 36. Swipe the context element Scenario: Switch slides When I change context to element located by `accessibilityId(carousel)` Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `0` When I swipe LEFT to element located by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `1` Executes the sequence of touch actions. When I execute sequence of touch actions: $actions $actions - The table with actions to execute. Table 1. Possible actions type argument Argument example TAP Element locator or empty By.id(Name) TAP_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty By.id(Name) MOVE_TO Element locator By.id(username) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point, that specifies x and y distance to move from its current position or from upper left corner (0,0), if the pointer has not previously been moved (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE empty WAIT Duration PT1S - wait 1 second RELEASE action releases the finger at the current touch location. For example, it can be used in the following sequence of actions:`TAP_AND_HOLD` → MOVE_BY_OFFSET → RELEASE Example 37. Execute touch actions When I execute sequence of touch actions: |type |argument | |TAP_AND_HOLD |By.id(Hello World)| |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(0,200) | |RELEASE | | Performs zoom in/out Zoom in Zoom out The step takes into account the current context. If you need to perform zoom on the element, you need to switch the context to this element.

It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 41. Perform profiling during application usage When I start recording `Time Profiler` metrics !-- set of actions to measure performance When I stop recording `Time Profiler` metrics and save results to file `${outputDirectory}/time_profiler.zip` Sets the slider value in percents. The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypeSlider. The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively. When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypeSlider element. $percent - The target value of the slider in percents. Example 42. Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `90` percents Example 43. Set value of iOS slider (with range -50:50) to 20 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `70` percents Example 44. Set value of iOS slider (with range 18:65) to 55 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range. The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations. The target element must be of type android.widget.SeekBar. The number must be greater than or equal to 0. Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure. When I set value of Android slider located `$locator` to `$number` $locator - The locator to find android.widget.SeekBar element. $number - The number to set on the slider Example 45.

Set value of Android slider (with range 18:65) to 20 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `2` Takes a screenshot and publish it to the report. When I take screenshot Takes a screenshot and saves it to the file at the specified path. The full path to the file with the taken screenshot is posted to logs and report. When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `$screenshotFilePath` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I take screenshot and save it to folder `$screenshotFilePath` $screenshotFilePath - The path to the file to save the screenshot, the allowed values are: an absolute path to the file, e.g. C:\\Windows\\screenshot.png; a relative path (it is resolved from the current working directory, e.g. screenshot.png. Example 48. Take a screenshot and save it to the file When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `${screenshot-directory}/start-page.png` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 49. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 50. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for an element with the specified state to be found using the specified timeout with polling interval.

Example 51. Verify that the element become invisible up to 10 times When I wait `PT10S` with `PT1S` polling until element located by `id(element-to-hide)` becomes not visible Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 52. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 53. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Waits for element with the specified locator to stop moving. An element is considered moving when its coordinates (position) are changing. For example, an animated GIF is not a moving element unless it changes position. When I wait until element located by `$locator` stops moving $locator - Locator. Example 54. Wait for element with the specified id to stop moving When I wait until element located by `id(submitForm)` stops moving Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 55. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 56. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Saves text of an element into a variable.

Example 10. Set form data HTTP request body Given form data request: |name |value | |firstName|Ivan | |lastName |Ivanov | |password |!@3qwer| Adds HTTP headers to the existing HTTP headers of the building HTTP request. The added HTTP headers are scoped to the first performed HTTP request and not available afterwards. When I add request headers:$headers headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns name and value specifying HTTP header. Example 11. Add request header with name Accept-Language and value en-us When I add request headers: |name |value | |Accept-Language|en-us | When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with relative URL `/get?name=Content` When I save JSON element value from `${response}` by JSON path `$.headers.Accept-Language` to scenario variable `language` Then `${language}` is equal to `\"en-us\"` Sets HTTP headers to the building HTTP request. Previously set HTTP headers are discarded. The added HTTP headers are scoped to the first performed HTTP request and not available afterwards. When I set request headers:$headers headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns name and value specifying HTTP header. Example 12. Set request header with name Content-Type and value application/json When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| Given request body: { \"type\": \"article\" } When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `https://api.example.com/entries` Executes the HTTP request for a resource identified by the absolute URL. The step uses previously set HTTP headers and request body. The HTTP response headers, status code and body can be accessed by the corresponding steps and dynamic variables. When I execute HTTP $httpMethod request for resource with URL `$url` $httpMethod - The HTTP method. $url - The URL of the resource on the server. Example 13. Execute HTTP GET request When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Executes the HTTP request for a resource identified by the URL relative to the base URL specified by the rest-api.http.endpoint property. The step uses previously set HTTP headers and request body. The HTTP response headers, status code and body can be accessed via the corresponding steps and dynamic variables. When I execute HTTP $httpMethod request for resource with relative URL `$relativeURL` $httpMethod - The HTTP method. $relativeURL - The relative URL of the resource on the server. Example 14. Configuration rest-api.http.endpoint=https://httpbin.org Example 15. Execute HTTP GET request When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with relative URL `/image/jpeg` Compares the HTTP response body against the resource data according to the provided rule. Then response body $validationRule resource at `$resourcePath` $validationRule - The validation rule, either is equal to or is not equal to. $resourcePath - The resource path. Example 16. Compare images When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/image/png` Then response body is equal to resource at `/images/pig.png` Compares the HTTP response status code against the expected number. Then response code is $comparisonRule `$responseCode` $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $responseCode - The expected HTTP response status code. Example 17. Validate the resource is not found When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cfa2fdbc` Then response code is equal to `404` Compares the HTTP response time against the expected number in milliseconds. Then response time is $comparisonRule `$responseTime` milliseconds $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $responseTime - The expected response time in milliseconds. Example 18. Check HTTP response time When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Then response time is less than `1000` milliseconds Validates the number of HTTP response headers filtered by the specified name. Then number of response headers with name `$headerName` is $comparisonRule $number $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of headers. Example 19. Check the browser is forced to use a secure web connection Then number of response headers with name `Strict-Transport-Security` is equal to 1 Compares the header value against the expected value according to the comparison rule. Then value of response header `$headerName` $comparisonRule `$value` $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $comparisonRule - The string comparison rule. $number - The expected HTTP header value. Example 20. Check HTTP response content type When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/robots.txt` Then value of response header `Content-Type` is equal to `text/plain` Validates that the response header with the specified name contains elements. Might be useful to verify such HTTP headers as Set-Cookie that have values that can be decomposed into multiple elements. Example 21. HTTP header with elements format header = [ element ] *( \",\" [ element ] ) Then response header `$headerName` contains elements:$elements $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $attributes - The ExamplesTable with expected elements.

Verify HTTP resources Then HTTP resources are valid: | url | | https://saucelabs.com | | https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/img/vividus.png | Saves cookie to scope variable. If present several cookies with the same name will be saved cookie with the root path value (path is '/'). When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `$cookieName` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of cookie. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of variable. Example 33. Get cookie with name cookieName and save its value to scenario variable value When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue` When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value` Then '${value}' is equal to 'cookieValue' Change cookie value. If several cookies with the same name exist in cookie store, the value will be changed for all of them. When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `$cookieName` to `$newCookieValue` $cookieName - The name of cookie. $newCookieValue - The new value for $cookieName. Example 34. Get cookie with name cookieName and set new value for it newCookieValue When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue` When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `cookieName` to `newCookieValue` When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value` Then '${value}' is equal to 'newCookieValue' The step is moved to vividus-plugin-json.

Generates JSON Web Token (JWT) with header and payload signed with secret key using HmacSHA256 algorithm and saves the result to scope variable with the specified name. When I generate JWT with header `$header` and payload `$payload` signed with key `$key` using HS256 algorithm and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $header - The header of JWT. $payload - The payload of JWT. $key - Secret key used by HS256 algorithm to sign the token. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of variable to save the result. Example 35. Generate JWT with specified payload and header signed with key secretKey using HS256 algorithm and save result to scenario variable JWT Given I initialize scenario variable `header` with value `{\"typ\":\"JWT\",\"alg\":\"HS256\"}` Given I initialize scenario variable `payload` with value `{\"sub\":\"1234567890\",\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"admin\":true,\"jti\":\"c6859320-9fb3-4784-8c2f-1ab37044acfc\",\"iat\":#{toEpochSecond(#{generateDate(P, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)})},\"exp\":#{toEpochSecond(#{generateDate(P1D, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)})}}` When I generate JWT with header `${header}` and payload `${payload}` signed with key `secretKey` using HS256 algorithm and save result to scenario variable `JWT` In order to validate the body of the latest HTTP response use the response dynamic variable to access the body data in conjunction with any step responsible for data validation like data comparison, JSON, XML and other steps. Example 36. Validate response body When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then JSON element from `${response}` by JSON path `$.slideshow` is equal to ` { \"author\": \"Yours Truly\", \"date\": \"date of publication\", \"slides\": [ { \"title\": \"Wake up to WonderWidgets!\", \"type\": \"all\" }, { \"items\": [ \"Why WonderWidgets are great\", \"Who buys WonderWidgets\" ], \"title\": \"Overview\", \"type\": \"all\" } ], \"title\": \"Sample Slide Show\" } ` The HTTP response body can be saved into static variable by using the init variable step in conjunction with the response dynamic variable, it might be useful if you want to preserve the data for further computations since each subsequent HTTP call rewrites previously received response data.

Steps to establish baseline: Run step When I ESTABLISH baseline with name `name` Open report Save image using contextual mouse click → Save as into folder for baselines Compares actual appearance of the page or element against the baseline. Make sure that the baseline you compare against actually exists. Steps to compare baseline: Run step When I COMPARE_AGAINST baseline with name `name` Open report Review comparison results If you need to accept the new baseline: a) Switch to checkpoint view b) Contextual click on the checkpoint image → save as to baseline folder Work the same way as COMPARE_AGAINST except it checks if actual appearance differs from the baseline. In order to support screenshot taking configuration per-project/per-step basis framework provides following approach. Property based configuration could be specified using web.screenshot.strategy..= pattern, where: YOUR_STRATEGY_NAME - name of the custom strategy; PROPERTY_NAME - name of the property you want to specify. Property Name Acceptable values Description web.screenshot.strategy..web-header-to-cut size in pixels Web header to cut (could be useful if your site has sticky header) web.screenshot.strategy..web-footer-to-cut size in pixels Web footer to cut (could be useful if your site has sticky footer) web.screenshot.strategy..native-header-to-cut size in pixels Native header to cut web.screenshot.strategy..native-footer-to-cut size in pixels Native footer to cut web.screenshot.strategy..coords-provider WEB_DRIVER CEILING Adds margins to coordinates, default one web.screenshot.strategy..scroll-timeout The duration in ISO-8601 Durations format.

Here is an example how to configure third-party cookies behaviour. Example 6. Add the following property to allow all cookies web.driver.chrome.experimental-options={\"prefs\": {\"profile\": {\"cookie_controls_mode\": 0}}} The allowed values for the preference from the example are: 0 - allow all cookies; 1 - block third-party cookies; 2 - block third-party cookies in Incognito mode only. @proxy - some steps require proxy to be turned on: it can be done by setting the corresponding properties or by switching on this meta tag at story level. The expression parameters marked with bold are mandatory. Parses Data URL-s and decodes their data if Base64 encoding is set. The result of the expression depends on the MIME type of Data URL. The result will be a binary data in case of the binary MIME type and it will be a string for the text MIME type. If expression is applied to invalid Data URL the error will be thrown. #{decodeDataUrl($dataUrl)} $dataUrl - The Data URL to decode. Example 7. Decoding inlined image When I save `src` attribute value of element located by `id(image)` to scenario variable `image` When I compare against baseline with name `inlined-image` from image `#{decodeDataUrl(${image})}` Table 1. Examples of the expressions decoding Data URL Expression Result #{decodeDataUrl(data:,value)} value #{decodeDataUrl(data:text/plain,value)} value #{decodeDataUrl(data:;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==)} Hello, World! #{decodeDataUrl(data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==)} Hello, World! #{decodeDataUrl(data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==)} Hello, World! #{decodeDataUrl(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw…​.)} Image binary data. The variable provides the URL of the page currently loaded in the browser. ${current-page-url} Example 8. Validate redirect in the browser Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then `${current-page-url}` is equal to `https://docs.vividus.dev/vividus/latest/index.html` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access height and width of the browser window. Variable name Description browser-window-height the height of the browser window browser-window-width the width of the browser window Example 9. Check the dimension of the browser window When I change window size to `800x600` Then `${browser-window-width}` is = `800` Then `${browser-window-height}` is = `600` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 10. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 11. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Profiles allow to choose or parameterize browser that tests run on. See more details on the profiles and nesting strategy on the configuration page. Web-application plugin contains significant number of built-in profiles. They can be found after plugin installation by the following path in Eclipse IDE: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-web-app-X.Y.Z -> properties -> profile -> web Let’s go through the structure and review its content. General place for web profiles. Each of the directory contains browser related properties. This is a place for adjustments for your browser. Add there any properties you need: screen resolution, path to driver or to a custom browser. While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to use custom browser driver. This approach first requires manually downloading the driver (See Quick Reference Section for download links). The path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..driver-executable-path=/path/to/driver/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox safari iexplore edge opera While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to configure path to browser executable file. In general cases it’s not required, installed browsers are found automatically (except Opera browser). Also, for example, if browser is not installed, but only downloaded and unpacked into some folder, the path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..binary-path=/path/to/custom/browser/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox edge opera Profile Example of properties web/desktop/chrome selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments=--disable-auto-reload web/desktop/edge selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=12.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=MicrosoftEdge web/desktop/firefox selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.firefox.command-line-arguments=--turbo web/desktop/iexplore selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=internet explorer web.driver.iexplore.command-line-arguments=-private selenium.grid.capabilities.iedriverVersion=3.141.0 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=7 web/desktop/opera selenium.grid.screen-resolution=1920x1080 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 In order to run tests in Opera browser locally, it is required to configure browser path. web/desktop/safari selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=11.00 Built-in devices Chrome allows to emulate view on mobile devices using Device mode. Such feature is reflected in mobile_emulation subdirectory in Profiles. Use device-name property to mention target device: web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.device-name=DEVICE_NAME Available for emulation devices you can find in the Dimensions list in chrome. Custom devices In case you need to use Responsive Viewport Mode and set up your own device, update the screen resolution in the following properties: web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.width=1440 web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.height=900 Headless mode is a functionality that allows the execution of a full version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display, meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The following profiles running browsers in headless mode are available: web/headless/chrome web/headless/firefox The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 12.

Main page can be set by the property web-application.main-page-url in the property file. Given I am on main application page Example 13. Open page defined in the web-application.main-page-url variable Given I am on main application page Loading the page with a given absolute URL, e.g. https://example.com/. Given I am on page with URL `$pageURL` Example 14. Open 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Navigates the browser to the specific path in the current host defined in the relative URL step parameter. A relative URL can point to a file within a web site (like about.html or /products). If the parameter starts with '/' char, navigation will be performed from the root of the host, see examples below. If the parameter starts without '/' char or with './', navigation will be performed from the current path directory. Table 2. Examples Current page Relative URL parameter Opened page https://mysite.com about.html https://mysite.com/about.html https://mysite.com /products/new https://mysite.com/products/new https://mysite.com/path/foo stats https://mysite.com/path/foo/stats https://mysite.com/path/foo ./docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo/docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo /documents https://mysite.com/documents When I go to relative URL `$relativeURL` relativeURL - A string value of the relative URL. Open main application page and then navigate to '/products/new' page on the application host Given I am on main application page When I go to relative URL `/products/new` Refreshes the page: the step does the same as the reload button in the browser. When I refresh page Checks the page title matches to the text according to the provided string validation rule Then page title $comparisonRule `$text` $comparisonRule - string validation rule. One of: is equal to - title should be equal to text contains - title should contain text does not contain - title should not contain text text - the text of the title to compare Example 15. Validate 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title is equal to `What is VIVIDUS :: VIVIDUS` Example 16. Validate the part of 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title contains `VIVIDUS` Clicks on the element found by the specified locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the element by the locator; click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is occurred at any atomic action. If element by the specified locator is not clickable (overlapped by another element, problems with page/context loading or the element is disabled) the step will fail with corresponding error: Could not click on the element: org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted: Element Where to Buy is not clickable at point (1619, 275). Other element would receive the click: ... When I click on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 17. Click on element When I click on element located by `name(Submit)` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 18. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located by `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view. When I scroll element located by `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 19. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located by `id(way_down_button)` into view Checks if the page is scrolled to the specific element Then page is scrolled to element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 20. Validate Contact link is scrolled into view Then page is scrolled to element located by `xpath(//a[text()=\"Contact\"])` Validates that the text is presented in the current context. Expected text is case sensitive. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text `$text` exists $text - Expected text. Example 21. Check the text 'Contract Us' is presented on the page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then text `Contract Us` exists Validates that the text is not presented in the current context. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text `$text` does not exist $text - Text that should not exist. Example 22. Check the text 'Deprecated' is not presented in the element When I change context to element located by `id(code)` Then text `Deprecated` does not exist Opens a new browser tab and switches the focus for future commands to this tab. When I open new tab Example 23. Open page in a new tab When I open new tab Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL. The key difference of this step from the previous one opening a new tab is that this step inherits the state of the previous page, i.e.: new tab will have acces to the session storage of the previous tab, it will be possible to handle alerts appearing on tab closing. When I open URL `$URL` in new tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open. Example 24. Open docs in a new tab When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new tab Closes the current tab and switches to the previous tab. When I close current tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current tab with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open. Example 25. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new tab When I close current tab Trying to close the current tab with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current tab with possibility to handle alert Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current tab was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new tab. If you confirm window close in alert, the tab will be closed, and you will need to switch to current tab using the following step: When I switch to tab with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 26. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new tab When I click on element located by `xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current tab with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Table 3. Possible actions type argument Argument example DOUBLE_CLICK Element locator or empty. By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty. By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point. (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Element locator or empty. By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text to type. Minsk City CLICK Element locator or empty. By.caseSensitiveText(Done) PRESS_KEYS Comma-separated keys to press and release. BACK_SPACE KEY_DOWN Comma-separated keys to press one by one. CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Comma-separated keys to release one by one. CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Element locator. By.id(username) Windows/Unix and macOS platforms have different keyboards. For example, Ctrl+C combination is used to copy text on Windows and Unix, but ⌘ Command+C should be used on macOS with default preferences. In order to close this gap VIVIDUS offers unique key OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL: it is mapped to CONTROL key on Windows/Unix and to COMMAND key on macOS. Using this key it is possible to make tests fully platform independent. Example 27. Execute various web-actions When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | This step can be used to perform clipboard interactions. Example 28. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on Windows When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, CONTROL| Example 29. Paste text from the clipboard to the focused field on MacOS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |COMMAND, v| |KEY_UP |v, COMMAND| Example 30. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on any OS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL| This set of steps allows to validate the browser console logging messages. In order to configure availability of the INFO level messages use following properties: Browser Property to enable INFO logs Google Chrome selenium.capabilities.goog\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Microsoft Edge Chromium selenium.capabilities.ms\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Validates the absence of log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. Example 31. Validate absence of JS errors Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` Then there are no browser console ERRORS Validates the absence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels by regex `$regex` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): Then there are no browser console $logLevels by regex '$regex' $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $regex - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 32. Validate absence of JS error referencing user Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` Then there are no browser console ERRORS by regex `.*user.*` Validates the presence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are browser console $logLevels by regex `$regex` $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $regex - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 33. Validate presence of JS errors referencing user Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` Then there are browser console ERRORS by regex `.*user.*` Waits for the appearance of the console log entries with the expected level and which match regular expression and saves all the entries (including awaited ones) of the expected level gathered during the wait to the scoped variable. Wait uses generic UI timeouts specified by the properties ui.wait.timeout and ui.wait.polling-period. See Properties section for more details. When I wait until browser console $logEntries by regex `$regex` appear and save all entries into $scopes variable `$variableName` $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $regex - The regular expression to match log entry messages. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the value of the barcode. Example 34. Wait for application readiness Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` When I wait until browser console infos by regex `.*Application ready.*` appear and save all entries into scenario variable `logs` Then `${logs}` matches `.*Application ready in \\d+ seconds.*` Executes the steps against all elements found by locator. After a required number of elements is found, search context switches in order for each found element and performs all steps on it. If comparison rule mismatch steps will not be performed even if elements are found. When I find $comparisonRule `$number` elements by `$locator` and for each element do$stepsToExecute Alias: When I find $comparisonRule '$number' elements by $locator and for each element do$stepsToExecute $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The number of elements to find. $locator - The locator used to find elements. $stepsToExecute - The ExamplesTable with a single column containing the steps to execute. Example 35. Script type check When I find = `5` elements by `By.xpath(//script):a` and for each element do |step | |When I set 'type' attribute value of the context element to the 'scenario' variable 'type'| |Then `${type}` is equal to `text/javascript` | Switches context to the root element of the current page. When I switch back to page Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch back to the page Example 36. Switch to user context and back to the default context of page Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/elementState.html` When I change context to element located by `id(button-hide)` Then text `Element to hide` does not exist When I switch back to page Then text `Element to hide` exists Switches to or element using one of the supported locators. When I switch to frame located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to frame located `$locator` $locator - Locator of frame element. Example 37. Switch to frame Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/nestedFrames.html` Then text `Modal Frame Example` does not exist When I switch to frame located by `id(parent)` Then text `Modal Frame Example` exists Switch the focus of future browser commands to new tab. This step gets the identifier of the currently active tab and then switches focus to the first available tab with a different identifier. For example, if tabs #1, #2, #3 are open and tab #2 is active, this step will switch focus to tab #3. A new tab should already be open for this step to function. After executing this step, the new tab will become the active tab. When I switch to new tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to a new window Example 38. Open the new tab by link and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows` When I click on element located by `linkUrlPart(/windows/new)` Then text `New Window` does not exist When I switch to new tab Then text `New Window` exists Switch the focus of future browser commands to new tab with specified title.

Example 47. Verify that the element become invisible up to 10 times When I wait `PT10S` with `PT1S` polling until element located by `id(element-to-hide)` becomes not visible Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 48. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 49. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Waits for element with the specified locator to stop moving. An element is considered moving when its coordinates (position) are changing. For example, an animated GIF is not a moving element unless it changes position.

Wait for element with the specified id to stop moving When I wait until element located by `id(submitForm)` stops moving Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 51. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements.

Example 100. Set the session storage item When I set session storage item with key `token` and value `session-token` Validates the web storage item with the specified key exists. Then $storageType storage item with key `$key` exists $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. $key - The name of the key to check presence. Example 101. Check the session storage item is present Then session storage item with key `token` exists Validates the web storage item with the specified key does not exist. Then $storageType storage item with key `$key` does not exist $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. $key - The key of the local storage item to check absence. Example 102. Check the local storage item is not present Then local storage item with key `token` does not exist This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The actions preformed by the step: extract HTTP messages from the recorded proxy archive filter out the HTTP messages with the response status code 302 Moved Temporarily find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression check that the total number of the found HTTP messages satisfies the desired condition In case of failure the full HTTP archive (HAR) is attached to the report. Then number of HTTP $httpMethods requests with URL pattern `$urlPattern` is $comparisonRule `$number` $httpMethods - The comma-separated HTTP methods to filter by $urlPattern - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL $comparisonRule - Comparison Rule $number - The number to compare with Example 103. Check the number of HTTP GET and POST requests matching URL regular expression is equal to 1 Then number of HTTP GET, POST requests with URL pattern `http://httpbin\\.org/get` is equal to `1` Save the HTTP message part from the HTTP request with given URL-pattern into the variable with specified name and the scopes. This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The actions preformed by the step: extract HTTP messages from the recorded proxy archive filter out the HTTP messages with the response status code 302 Moved Temporarily find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression check that total number of the found HTTP messages is equal to 1 save the HTTP message part to the specified variable In case of failure the full HTTP archive (HAR) is attached to the report. When I capture HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` and save $httpMessagePart to $scopes variable `$variableName` $httpMethods - The \"or\"-separated set of HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. GET or POST or PUT. $urlPattern - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL. $httpMessagePart - The HTTP message part to save. One of: URL - The request URL. URL query - The request URL query parameters. request data - The request data includes the following keys: query - The URL query is stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the query parameter and value is the list of query parameter values. The query parameter values are accessible via zero-based index. requestBody.mimeType - The MIME type of posted data, the variable will not be saved if MIME type is not present. requestBody.text - The posted data as plain text, the variable will not be saved if the request body is not present. requestBodyParameters - The form data parameters are stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the form parameter and value is the list of form parameter values. The form parameter values are accessible via zero-based index. responseStatus - The response status, the variable will not be saved if the response is not present. response data - The response data includes the following keys: responseBody.mimeType - The MIME type of response data, the variable will not be saved if MIME type is not present. responseBody.text - The response data as plain text, the variable will not be saved if the response body is not present. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the HTTP message part. Example 104. Validate the URL of the matching HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET or POST request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL to scenario variable `URL` Then `${URL}` is equal to `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Example 105. Validate the URL query of the matching HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL query to scenario variable `query` Then `${query.q[0]}` is equal to `vividus` Then `${query.q}` is equal to `[vividus]` Then `${query}` is equal to `{q=[vividus]}` Example 106. Validate the request data from the matching HTTP message Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` and save request data to scenario variable `data` Then `${data.query}` is equal to `{}` Then `${data.requestBodyParameters}` is equal to `{delivery=, custtel=, comments=, custemail=, custname=}` Then `${data.requestBody}` is not equal to `null` Then `${data.responseStatus}` is equal to `200` Example 107. Validate the response data from the matching HTTP message Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` and save request data to scenario variable `data` Then `${data.responseBody.text}` is equal to `{\"status\": \"ok\"}` Then `${data.responseBody.mimeType}` is equal to `application/json` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Waits for the HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and URL regular expression. If no HTTP request is sent and wait timeout is reached, then the step will fail. When I wait until HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` exists in proxy log $httpMethods - the \"or\"-separated HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. 'GET or POST or PUT' $urlPattern - the regular expression to match HTTP request URL Example 108. Wait for the HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I wait until HTTP GET or POST request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` exists in proxy log Then number of HTTP GET or POST requests with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` is equal to `1` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Add headers to the proxied HTTP request satisfying the desired condition When I add headers to proxied requests with URL pattern which $comparisonRule `$url`:$headers $comparisonRule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 109. Add headers to the proxied HTTP request When I add headers to proxied requests with URL pattern which is equal to `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus`: |name |value | |testName1|testValue1| |testName2|testValue2| Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Then a JSON element from '${response}' by the JSON path '$.headers' is equal to ' { \"Testname1\": \"testValue1\", \"Testname2\": \"testValue2\" } 'ignoring extra fields This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The step clears the HTTP requests and responses recorded by the proxy When I clear proxy log Example 110. Clear the data recorded by the proxy Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I clear proxy log Then number of HTTP GET requests with URL pattern 'https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus' is equal to `0` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The step clears previously created mocks When I clear proxy mocks Example 111. Clear the proxy mocks When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which CONTAINS `vividus` using response code `200`, content `#{loadResource(page.html)}` and headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|text/html| When I clear proxy mocks Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Then number of elements found by `id(sw)` is = `0` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Mocks HTTP response by methods with a provided content No actual request will be executed. Short-circuited response will be returned. When I mock HTTP $httpMethods responses with request URL which $comparisonRule `$url` using response code `$responseCode`, content `$payload` and headers:$headers $httpMethods - The \"or\"-separated set of HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. GET or POST or PUT. $rule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $code - The response status code $content - The content to send within a response $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 112. Hijack a page When I mock HTTP POST responses with request URL which CONTAINS `example` using response code `202`, content `#{loadResource(mocked-example.json)}` and headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Mocks HTTP response with a provided content No actual request will be executed. Short-circuited response will be returned. When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which $comparisonRule `$url` using response code `$responseCode`, content `$payload` and headers:$headers $rule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $code - The response status code $content - The content to send within a response $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 113. Hijack a page When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which CONTAINS `example.com` using response code `200`, content `#{loadResourceAsByteArray(page.html)}` and headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|text/html| This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Mocks HTTP response No actual request will be executed. Short-circuited response will be returned. When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which $comparisonRule `$url` using response code `$responseCode` and headers:$headers $rule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $code - The response status code $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 114. 404 page When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which CONTAINS `example.com` using response code `404` and headers: |name |value| |Content-Length|0 | Changes the current browser window size to the specified one. The specified browser window size should be smaller than the current screen resolution. When I change window size to `$targetSize` $targetSize - The desired browser window size in pixels, e.g. 800x600, where the first measure is window width, the last one is window height. Example 115. Resize the browser window Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I change window size to `640x320` Steps allow to interact with video elements. Starts video playback. When I play video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Pauses video playback. When I pause video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Rewinds video to the desired mark in seconds. When I rewind time to `$number` seconds in video player located `$locator` $number - time mark in seconds $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Saves video player info: duration, currentTime, src, networkState. For more information about the properties see HTML Audio/Video Properties When I save info from video player located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find video player. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the info. If the variable name is info, the following variables will be created: ${info.src}- The current source of the audio/video element ${info.duration} - The length of the current audio/video (in seconds) ${info.currentTime} - The current playback position in the audio/video(in seconds) ${info.networkState} - The current network state of the audio/video. For more information see: Network State Example 116. Video player verifications Given I am on page with URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqyVpCV-3c` When I pause video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I rewind time to `777` seconds in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I play video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I save info from video player located `cssSelector(video)` to SCENARIO variable `info` Then `${info.currentTime}` is > `0` Then `${info.duration}` is > `1000` Then `${info.networkState}` is = `2` Then `${info.src}` matches `.+youtube.+` Allows to set command line arguments for browsers. This step works similar to the property web.driver..command-line-arguments In case both property and step are used - arguments from property will be ignored. Step will take effect for all new browser sessions created in the current story. It will not affect the current sessions. List of supported command line arguments for popular browsers: . Chrome . Firefox . Internet Explorer Not supported browsers: . Safari . Edge When I set browser command line arguments to `$argsString` $argsString - Sequence of command line arguments, separated by space. Example 117. Set the browser to use the mocked camera stream When I set browser command line arguments to `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream --use-file-for-fake-video-capture=${videoStorage}/${video1}.y4m --use-fake-device-for-media-stream` Given I am on main application page Executes async JavaScript code and saves result into variable. When I execute async javascript `$jsCode` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $jsCode - Any JavaScript code. In order to save a result return statement should be used. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie value. Example 118. Validate response When I execute async javascript ` var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1]; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', '/resource/data.json', true); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState == 4) { callback(xhr.responseText); } }; xhr.send();` and save result to scenario variable `response` Then `${response}` matcher `.+` Waits for element disappearance with desired timeout. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). Then element located by `$locator` disappears in `$timeout` $locator - The locator used to element. $timeout - The maximum time to wait for the element disappearance in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 119. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the element for 3 seconds When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' Then element located by 'xpath(//div[@id='delayed'])' disappears in 'PT3S' This step allows you to save an HTML table from a specified context into a variable. For more information, see how to work with table variables The HTML table must have a header row with tags. When I save table to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to refer to the variable value. Before using this step, ensure the context is set to the required table. See the example below. Example 120. Save the first table on the page into a variable named 'table' When I change context to element located `xpath(//table[1])` When I save table to SCENARIO variable `table` Saves the number of currently opened tabs in the browser to the variable. When I save number of open tabs to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to refer to the variable value. Example 121. Save the number of currently opened browser tabs into a variable named 'count' When I save number of open tabs to SCENARIO variable `count` Accepts the action in popup alert with matching text by clicking on the \"OK\" button or dismiss it by clicking \"Cancel\" button. Actions performed at this step: Finds the appropriate alert with matching message Performs the corresponding action When I $alertAction alert with message which $comparisonRule `$message` $alertAction - Action to perform. Possible values: ACCEPT, DISMISS. $comparisonRule - String comparison rule. $message - The text message of the alert. Example 122. Accept popup alert with any text message When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` This step allows you to type text into popup alert input field and then accept the alert. This step is applicable only for alerts with a single input field. For authorization alerts, basic URL authorization should be used. For example, https://user:pass@domain.com When I type text `$text` in alert and accept it $text - The text to be typed into the alert input field. Example 123. Type text 'VIVIDUS' into alert and close it by clicking OK button When I type text `VIVIDUS` in alert and accept it Checks that there is popup alert on the page. Then an alert is present Example 124. Check that an alert appears after clicking on the button When I click on element located by `buttonName(Survey)` Then an alert is present Checks that there is no any popup alerts on the page. Then an alert is not present Example 125. Check that an alert doesn’t appear on the page Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` Then an alert is not present To validate host component of the current page URL the following statement can be used: Example 126. Validate host component of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `#{extractHostFromUrl(${current-page-url})}` is equal to `example.com` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. To validate path component of the current page URL the following statement can be used: Example 127. Validate path component of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `#{extractPathFromUrl(${current-page-url})}` is equal to `/relative/url/example.html` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. To validate whether current page URL contains some part the following statement can be used: Example 128. Validate part of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `${current-page-url}` matches `.+\\/relative\\/url.+` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. .+\\/relative\\/url.+ is a regular expression to match the expected part of the page URL.","title":"Web
