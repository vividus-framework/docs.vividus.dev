Synonyms: examples table, data table. ExamplesTable represents a tabular structure that holds rows of example data for parameters named via the column headers: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| Rows starting with an ignorable separator (defaults to |--) are allowed and ignored: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |-- A commented row --| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |-- Another commented row --| |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The separators are also configurable via inlined properties: {ignorableSeparator=!--,headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!} !header 1!header 2! .... !header n! !-- A commented row --! !value 11!value 12! .... !value 1n! ... !-- Another commented row --! !value m1!value m2! .... !value mn! Comments in column values are supported via the commentSeparator inlined property: {commentSeparator=#} | header 1#comment | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11#comment | value 12 | .... | value 1n | Comments including the separator are stripped. By default all column values are trimmed. To avoid trimming the values, use the trim inlined property: {trim=false} | header 1 | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11 | value 12 | .... | value 1n | By default, all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However, it might be required to map certain values to null-s. This can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| Line break is a default separator for rows in ExamplesTable, that’s why they can’t be added as is to the data. In order to put value with line breaks to ExamplesTable escape sequences (a character preceded by a backslash \\ is an escape sequence) must be used. Escape Sequence Description \\n< Insert a newline in the value at this point. \\r Insert a carriage return in the text at this point. \\\\ Insert a backslash character in the text at this point. The inlined property processEscapeSequences defines whether escape sequences should be replaced in the data. It’s false by default (no property is declared explicitly). The allowed values are true and false, any other values are considered invalid and will lead to parsing error. {processEscapeSequences=true, commentSeparator=#} |header | |line 1\\nline 2 |# The value with a newline |line 1\\r\\nline 2|# The value with a carriage return and a newline |line 1\\\\nline 2 |# The value with an escaped escape sequence, the result will be \"line 1\\nline 2\" Synonyms: VIVIDUS expression. An expression is a special placeholder which is detected, evaluated and resolved during test execution. Expressions are used for the data generation and transformation. General expression syntax is: #{expression} During resolution process the expression placeholder is replaced with the result of the expression evaluation. If expression is unknown for VIVIDUS, the placeholder will be kept as is. If expression evaluation results in error, it will be propagated to the top level and the test will be marked as broken. It’s allowed to construct nested expressions: in this case the evaluation starts with the deepest expression. Expressions may include any number of variables placeholders. Synonyms: project resource, test resource. A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExamplesTable transformer. ExamplesTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\. Example 1. Escaping special characters in transformer properties {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER, countries=\\{Australia\\,Canada\\}} In the example above the transformer will have a single property with name countries and value {Australia,Canada}. VIVIDUS variables of scopes global and next batches can be used in transformer properties (pay attention to escapes of the variables placeholders in the example below). Example 2. Usage of global variable ${locale} in transformer property {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER, tables=/$\\{locale\\}/table1.table;/$\\{locale\\}/table2.table}","title":"Glossary","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"glossary","url":"/vividus/latest/glossary.html","titles":[{"text":"ExamplesTable","hash":"_examplestable","id":1},{"text":"Preserving whitespace","hash":"_preserving_whitespace","id":2},{"text":"Mapping values to null-s","hash":"_mapping_values_to_null_s","id":3},{"text":"Using values with line breaks","hash":"_using_values_with_line_breaks","id":4},{"text":"Expression","hash":"_expression","id":5},{"text":"Resource","hash":"_resource","id":6},{"text":"Table Transformer","hash":"_table_transformer","id":7}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"VIVIDUS is a test automation tool that offers already implemented solution for testing of most popular application types.

Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued. The following properties are used to configure batches (VIVIDUS doesn’t provide any default batch configuration out of the box). batch-number is one-based batch index. The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property Default value Description bdd.story-loader.batch-.resource-location The test project path to the folder with story-files bdd.story-loader.batch-.resource-include-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be included in the batch. Leading and trailing whitespaces in patterns are omitted. bdd.story-loader.batch-.resource-exclude-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be excluded from the batch.

For example dry-run could be useful to debug what stroies will be executed with provided config. bdd.configuration.skip-story-if-given-story-failed false Skips the story in case of failure in the given story bdd.configuration.formats JSON,XML Available formats of the output files with test execution results statistics.print-failures false If set to true prints table of failures including: story, scenario, step and error message report.text-length-diff-threshold 100 Defines text threshold length to enable unified diff report publishing on failure, for variable comparisons. If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question \"What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?\". These specifics (properties) should be written in the profile.properties file. Path to this file is set in configuration.properties file: Example 2. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=web It’s allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones. Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into profile.properties files in appropriate places. Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution. Let’s create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let’s see profiles structure for this case: └─ src/main/resources/properties └─ profile (1) ├─ web (2) ├─ chrome (4) └─ profile.properties (6) ├─ firefox (4) └─ profile.properties └─ profile.properties (5) ├─ mobile_app (2) ├─ iOS (7) └─ profile.properties ├─ android (7) └─ profile.properties (9) └─ profile.properties (8) └─ profile.properties (3) 1 Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties; 2 General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device; 3 The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device; 4 Web browsers' profiles (directories); 5 Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles; 6 Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices; 7 Mobile profiles (directories); 8 Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only; 9 Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup; By default, profile property is pointed to the /src/main/resources/properties/profile directory, so use the relative path starting from profile when you have nested directories: Example 3. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android Some of the plugins, like web-app, have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers. Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration. Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into environment.properties file. The path to this file is set in configuration.properties file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them: Example 4. configuration.properties configuration.environments=dev #configuration.environments=test #configuration.environments=prod Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the same approach of reusing and separating values. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 5. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 6. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @severity 1 @layout desktop Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.epam.com/' Then the page title is equal to 'EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting' Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @severity 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.google.com/' Then the page title is equal to 'Google' The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 7. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 8. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 9. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 10. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @severity Numeric values (range 1-5) Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important Test, the highest number is the least important. @severity 1 @layout desktop, phone, phone_portrait, phone_landscape, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet, tablet_landscape, tablet_portrait Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 11. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 12. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all RED 3 Test report isn’t generated RED Here one could find description of general HTTP properties applied across all the HTTP interactions in VIVIDUS. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description General http.circular-redirects-allowed boolean false Allow circular redirects (redirects to the same location) http.connection-request-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the client connections pool. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.connect-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.max-total-connections integer 80 The number of maximum total connections for the client connections pool http.max-connections-per-route integer 60 The number of maximum connections per route for the client connections pool http.socket-timeout integer 3000 The timeout in milliseconds used for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.cookie-spec default, ignoreCookies, standard-strict, standard, netscape default The name of the cookie specification to be used for HTTP state management Authentication http.auth.username character sequence The username, presence of this property requires the http.auth.password to be also set http.auth.password character sequence The password, presence of this property requires the http.auth.username to be also set http.auth.preemptive-auth-enabled boolean false If enabled the HTTP client will send the basic authentication data even before the service gives an unauthorized response (401), useful when the service doesn’t support unauthorized response (401) or to reduce the overhead of making the connection SSL handshake http.ssl.check-certificate boolean true Verify certificates sent by the server during SSL handshake, the most common errors occured during verfication are Expired SSL Certificate Error, SSL Certificate Not Trusted Error, SSL Certificate Revoked Error etc. http.ssl.verify-hostname boolean true Verify if the domain name in the SSL certificate matches the domain name in URL where the request is sent to Two-Way SSL authentication http.key-store.type KeyStore types JKS The key store type http.key-store.path Resource The key store to load http.key-store.password string The password used to unlock the key store and for the integrity checking http.ssl.private-key-password string The password for the private key DNS resolver http.local-dns-storage. key-value mapping The property prefix used to override the OS DNS lookup by specifying hostname to IP address mappings e.g. http.local-dns-storage.coursera.org=52.84.197.20 Service unavailability retry handler http.service-unavailable-retry.max-retries integer 1 The maximum number of allowed retries if the server responds with a HTTP code specified in http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes property http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes set of integers The set of HTTP status codes to be retried. If it’s empty, no retries will be performed http.service-unavailable-retry.retry-interval ISO-8601 duration PT1S The retry interval between subsequent requests Idempotent retry handler http.idempotent-methods-sending-request-body set of integers The list of HTTP methods containing request body which should be treated as idempotent for retries Most common use cases for externalized configuration are tests parametrization with properties passed from CI/CD pipeline, passing of secrets into test run etc. The available approaches are listed below. Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value bdd.variables.global.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.bdd.variables.global.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.bdd.variables.global.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. Generate the overriding.properties file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project. The following script assumes that we are in the root of the test project folder. cat > src/main/resources/overriding.properties << EOD bdd.variables.global.some-key-1=value1 bdd.variables.global.some-key-2=value2 EOD This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. VIVIDUS allows to store values of the properties in the encrypted form. VIVIDUS uses Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) which provides two-way encryption mechanism. While performing two-way encryption, apart from feeding plain-text it’s required to feed the secret text (i.e. password) and this secret text is used to decrypt the encrypted text. The default encryption algorithm is PBEWithMD5AndDES. Download the latest Jasypt release Unpack the downloaded zip-archive Go to bin folder Run the command perfoming encryption: Example 13. Windows: encrypt.bat input=\"This is my message to be encrypted\" password=MYPAS_WORD Example 14. Linux/UNIX/macOS: ./encrypt.sh input=\"This is my message to be encrypted\" password=MYPAS_WORD where input - Any string to be encrypted. password - Your encryption password. MYPAS_WORD is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption. Find the encrypted data in OUTPUT section Example 15. Encryption command output ----ENVIRONMENT----------------- Runtime: Eclipse Adoptium OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17+35 ----ARGUMENTS------------------- input: This is my message to be encrypted password: MYPAS_WORD ----OUTPUT---------------------- WVnXhzG704KRZZFYL7hfpA4YoSm8V2F5eNXyr7CRYCichteHvNS3nB23zaI8CuLy Find more details in Jasypt CLI Tools documentation Use this tool at your own risk, since there is a chance of potential leakage of sensitive data Paste plain text string to encrypt to the corresponding text field. Set Type of Encryption to \"Two Way Encryption (With Secret Text)\". Enter secret key/text in the corresponding text field. Click \"Encrypt\". The resulting encrypted string can be copied from the corresponding field. Add the secret key/text to the project properties as the value of: system.vividus.encryptor.password=MYPAS_WORD This value must be kept secret and must not be committed to version control system. MYPAS_WORD is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption. Use the wrapping ENC(…​) for any encrypted property value. e.g. http.auth.password=ENC(WVnXhzG704KRZZFYL7hfpA4YoSm8V2F5eNXyr7CRYCichteHvNS3nB23zaI8CuLy) Please see Externalized Configuration to find the ways how encryptor password can be passed to the tests. VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let’s take the following step: Example 16. VIVIDUS step When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` Create a new JSON file (for example, aliases/aliases.json) and put the following content with one or more aliases: Example 17. aliases/aliases.json [ { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`\", \"aliases\": [ { \"name\": \"When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `$locator`\" }, { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse pointer over web element located `$locator`\" } ] } ] Point the alias configuration property to an exact location or location pattern with the JSON files containing ailases: engine.alias-paths=aliases/aliases.json Use the defned alias in place of actual step in your story When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `id(loginButton)`","title":"Tests Configuration","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"tests-configuration","url":"/vividus/latest/tests-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"configuration.properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":1},{"text":"Suites","hash":"_suites","id":2},{"text":"Profiles","hash":"_profiles","id":3},{"text":"Profiles setup","hash":"_profiles_setup","id":4},{"text":"Built-in profiles","hash":"_built_in_profiles","id":5},{"text":"Environments","hash":"_environments","id":6},{"text":"Known Issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":7},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":8},{"text":"Known Issues file","hash":"_known_issues_file","id":9},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":10},{"text":"Meta tags","hash":"_meta_tags","id":11},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":12},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_2","id":13},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":14},{"text":"1D tags (@key)","hash":"_1d_tags_key","id":15},{"text":"2D tags (@key  value)","hash":"_2d_tags_key_value","id":16},{"text":"Story Prioritization","hash":"_story_prioritization","id":17},{"text":"Exit codes","hash":"_exit_codes","id":18},{"text":"HTTP Configuration","hash":"_http_configuration","id":19},{"text":"Externalized Configuration","hash":"_externalized_configuration","id":20},{"text":"Sensitive Data Encryption","hash":"_sensitive_data_encryption","id":21},{"text":"How to encrypt a string","hash":"_how_to_encrypt_a_string","id":22},{"text":"Option 1 (Recommended): using Jasypt CLI","hash":"_option_1_recommended_using_jasypt_cli","id":23},{"text":"Option 2: using Jasypt Online","hash":"_option_2_using_jasypt_online","id":24},{"text":"How to use an encrypted string in VIVIDUS","hash":"_how_to_use_an_encrypted_string_in_vividus","id":25},{"text":"Steps aliases","hash":"_steps_aliases","id":26},{"text":"How to use steps aliases","hash":"_how_to_use_steps_aliases","id":27}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"via GIPHY","title":"The page is under construction","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"under-construction","url":"/vividus/latest/under-construction.html","titles":[]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"In scope of this article the task term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities and that produces some output based on the work done.

Also plugins may define own expressions (they are documented in the corresponding plugins articles). The expression parameters marked with bold are mandatory. Generate expression allows to create various types of data using Datafaker library. #{generate()} $expression - data type from the chosen data provider. Specify its name, desired method and required parameters to get data you want Let’s see the structure of the expression for the following example: #{generate(Internet.password '5', '10', 'true')} #{generate (1) (Internet (2) .password (3) '5', (4) '10', (4) 'true')} (4) 1 Generate expression itself; 2 Data provider from the list. In this case - Internet. Click on its name to see the methods it contains; 3 One of the available methods within Internet data provider - password. There are multiple choices, we picked the fourth one; 4 Available parameters for the chosen method; There are three of them: int minimumLength - minimum number of symbols; int maximumLength - maximum number of symbols; boolean includeUppercase - true or false for Uppercase usage; In this way we created an expression that generates a password from 5 to 10 characters length including uppercase letters. Possible output is 51gVj5aLZY Below you can find a list of examples. Please keep in mind, that the list is not full, all the expressions you can find here.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regaular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story. Variables are invalidated once the story is completed. next_batches Variables are available in the next batches. next_batches-scoped variable is not available in batch it’s declared within. batch Such variables are declared only with bdd.variables.batch-. prefix and available throughout the execution of the batch in the suite. An attempt to create the batch-scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 1. Declaring batch variable locale bdd.variables.batch-1.locale=/us/en/ bdd.variables.batch-2.locale=/uk/en/ Example 2. Using batch variable locale Given I am on the main application page When I go to the relative URL '${locale}' global Such variables are declared only via properties with bdd.variables.global. prefix and available throughout the entire execution. An attempt to create the globally scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 3. Declaring global variable login-endpoint bdd.variables.global.login-endpoint=https://my-auth-server.com/api/login Example 4. Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `${login-endpoint}` Then the response code is equal to '200' It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 5. Declaring global variable with expression random-user bdd.variables.global.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 6. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `/authenticate` Then the response code is equal to '200' Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, batch-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 7. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario When I initialize the scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` When I initialize the story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario.","title":"Variables","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"variables","url":"/vividus/latest/commons/variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution","id":1},{"text":"Regular variables","hash":"_regular_variables","id":2},{"text":"Scopes","hash":"_scopes","id":3},{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution_2","id":4}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Here one could find description of the steps that are delivered with Vividus itself without any plugins required.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

Invoke AWS Lambda function by providing the function name and the payload to pass to the Lambda function. When I invoke AWS Lambda function `$functionName` with payload `$payload` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $functionName - The name of AWS Lambda function, version, or alias. The value can be retrieved by looking at the function in the AWS Console. Supported name formats: Function name: my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias). Function ARN: arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function. Partial ARN: 123456789012:function:my-function. It’s allowed to append a version number or alias to any of the formats.

Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy. When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for Java, which defines how a client may access a database. Every JDBC requires using specific driver. JDBC drivers are client-side adapters (installed on the client machine, not on the server) that convert requests from Java programs to a protocol that the database management system (DBMS) can understand. Add plugin dependency into build.gradle file: Example 1. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.5.0-SNAPSHOT') Define your JDBC driver and add appropriate dependency. Let’s take PostgreSQL as an example: Open JDBC page on maven repository; Find driver for your database and open details (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver); Choose and open version (42.4.0); Go to the Gradle tab and copy implementation string; Paste chosen dependency into your build.gradle file: Example 2. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.4.0') In case Maven repository does not contain driver you need, please refer to the documentation of your database to define suitable JDBC driver. For database interaction, you will need to set related properties. They have db.connection. prefix followed by the database connection name (vividus in the example). Come up with your own database name to use within the tests. Put properties into the environment.properties file: Example 3. environment.properties db.connection.vividus.url=jdbc:dbms://databaseUrl:port/databaseName?parameter1=true¶meter2=value (1) db.connection.vividus.username= (2) db.connection.vividus.password= (2) db.connection.vividus.driver-class-name=(3) 1 Database address. Consists of: jdbc: - reference to JDBC; dbms: - Database Management System, e.g. postgresql; //databaseUrl - address to your database; :port - port number, e.g. 5432; /databaseName - name of your database; parameters - any additional driver parameters you need to pass; URL structure slightly changes depending on the database management system.

Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides gloablly-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilies have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 9. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 10. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 11. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 12. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Runs mobile application in the backround for specific period of time and either activates the app after a certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated (when PT-1S is used). See Appium docs for more details. When I send mobile application to background for `$period` period $period - The period of time in ISO-8601 format. Example 13. Run app in background When I send mobile application to background for `PT5S` period Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(login-button)` is equal to `1` Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The settings to set. Example 14. Configure to show invisible elements When I change Appium session settings: |name |value| |allowInvisibleElements|true | Uploads a file to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. Example 15. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image Deletes a file from the device/emulator/simulator. When I delete file `$filePath` from device Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to delete a file or a folder from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type is 'documents'. If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a file inside an application bundle /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle Example 16. Delete file When I delete file `/sdcard/Pictures/avatar.png` from device On iOS real device to add or delete photo or video to/from \"Camera Roll\" you need upload/delete photos or videos to/from /DCIM/100APPLE/ folder and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. Restart device is necessary after that. On iOS simulator to delete photo or video from \"Camera Roll\" you need to delete photo or video from /Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. And then restart simulator.

The step takes into account the current context. If you need to perform swipe on the element, you need to switch the context to this element. mobile-application.swipe.limit - defines max numbers of swipes to perform (if it’s reached the swipe process is stopped and the error is thrown) mobile-application.swipe.stabilization-duration - defines a duration to wait after swipe until view becomes stable mobile-application.swipe.vertical.x-position - defines a vertical swipe x axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to x=1 and 100 corresponds to x = mobile screen width - 1, default value is 0 mobile-application.swipe.horizontal.y-position - defines a horizontal swipe y axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to y=1 and 100 corresponds to y = mobile screen height - 1, default value is 50 When I swipe $direction to element located `$locator` with duration $swipeDuration $direction - The direction to swipe: UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. $locator - Locator. $swipeDuration - The swipe duration in ISO-8601 format. Example 29. Swipe to an element Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `0` When I swipe UP to element located `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `1` Example 30. Swipe the context element Scenario: Switch slides When I change context to element located `accessibilityId(carousel)` Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `0` When I swipe LEFT to element located `accessibilityId(slide 2)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `1` Selects a next or previous picker wheel value in date picker Only iOS platform is supported. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypePickerWheel. When I select $direction value with `$offset` offset in picker wheel located `$locator` $direction - The direction to search the value: NEXT or PREVIOUS. $offset - The ofset to pick from a middle of the wheel, see Select Picker Wheel Value guide. $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypePickerWheel element. Example 31. Select next item in the picker wheel When I select next value with `0.1` offset in picker wheel located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypePickerWheel)->filter.index(3)` Records performance metrics of iOS application. It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 32. Perform profiling during application usage When I start recording `Time Profiler` metrics !-- set of actions to measure performance When I stop recording `Time Profiler` metrics and save results to file `${outputDirectory}/time_profiler.zip` Sets the slider value in percents. The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypeSlider. The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively. When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypeSlider element. $percent - The target value of the slider in percents. Example 33. Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `90` percents Example 34. Set value of iOS slider (with range -50:50) to 20 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `70` percents Example 35. Set value of iOS slider (with range 18:65) to 55 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range. The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations. The target element must be of type android.widget.SeekBar. The number must be greater than or equal to 0. Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure. When I set value of Android slider located `$locator` to `$number` $locator - The locator to find android.widget.SeekBar element. $number - The number to set on the slider Example 36.

Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 39. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when locator’s visibility and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 40. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Waits for appearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 41. Wait for element appearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 42. Wait for element disappearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` disappears Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 43. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 44. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value.

Example 45. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 46. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 47. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 48. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Validates the element located by the locator has existed for the period specified by the duration. The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration. Then element located `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - The Locator to find an element. $duration - The period of time the element should have existed in ISO-8601 format. Example 49. The element should have existed for 5 second Then element located `By.id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Example 50. Navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `1` When I navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `0` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order. The collection should have more than 1 element with not empty text, otherwise the step fails. Then elements located `$locator` are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order $locator - Locator. $sortingOrder Plain Readable Description ASCENDING ascending Verify that elements are sorted in ascending order DESCENDING descending Verify that elements are sorted in descending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_ASCENDING case-insensitive ascending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive ascending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_DESCENDING case-insensitive descending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive descending order Example 51.

The plugin has the following actions: `ESTABLISH`, `COMPARE_AGAINST` and `CHECK_INEQUALITY_AGAINST` Creates a baseline image. Steps to establish baseline: Run step When I ESTABLISH baseline with name `name` Open report Save image using contextual mouse click → Save as into folder for baselines Compares actual appearance of the page or element against the baseline. Make sure that the baseline you compare against actually exists. Steps to compare baseline: Run step When I COMPARE_AGAINST baseline with name `name` Open report Review comparison results If you need to accept the new baseline: a) Switch to checkpoint view b) Contextual click on the checkpoint image → save as to baseline folder Work the same way as COMPARE_AGAINST except it checks if actual appearance differs from the baseline.

Here is an example how to configure third-party cookies behaviour. Example 6. Add the following property to allow all cookies web.driver.CHROME.experimental-options={\"prefs\": {\"profile\": {\"cookie_controls_mode\": 0}}} The allowed values for the preference from the example are: 0 - allow all cookies; 1 - block third-party cookies; 2 - block third-party cookies in Incognito mode only. @proxy - some steps require proxy to be turned on: it can be done by setting the corresponding properties or by switching on this meta tag at story level. The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access height and width of the browser window. Variable name Description browser-window-height the height of the browser window browser-window-width the width of the browser window Example 7. Check the dimension of the browser window When I change window size to `800x600` Then `${browser-window-width}` is = `800` Then `${browser-window-height}` is = `600` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 8. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 9. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Profiles allow to choose or parameterize browser that tests run on. See more details on the profiles and nesting strategy on the configuration page. Web-application plugin contains significant amount of built-in profiles. They can be found after plugin installation by the following path in Eclipse IDE: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-web-app-X.Y.Z -> properties -> profile -> web Let’s go through the structure and review its content. General place for web profiles. Each of the directory contains browser related properties. This is a place for adjustments for your browser. Add there any properties you need: screen resolution, path to webdriver or to a custom browser. Profile Example of properties web/desktop/chrome selenium.browser=chrome selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments=--disable-auto-reload web.driver.chrome.binary-path=/path/to/custom/chrome web/desktop/edge.chromium selenium.browser=edge_chromium selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=12.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=MicrosoftEdge web/desktop/firefox selenium.browser=firefox selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.firefox.command-line-arguments=--turbo web/desktop/iexplore selenium.browser=iexplore selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=internet explorer web.driver.iexplore.command-line-arguments=-private selenium.grid.capabilities.iedriverVersion=3.141.0 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=7 web/desktop/opera selenium.browser=opera selenium.grid.screen-resolution=1920x1080 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 To run tests in Opera browser locally it is required to set the following property: web.driver.OPERA.binary-path= - path to the Opera browser (for example, \"C:/Programs/Opera/opera.exe\") web/desktop/safari selenium.browser=safari selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=11.00 Built-in devices Chrome allows to emulate view on mobile devices using Device mode. Such feature is reflected in mobile_emulation subdirectory in Profiles. Use device-name property to mention target device: web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.device-name=DEVICE_NAME Available for emulation devices you can find in the Dimensions list in chrome. Custom devices In case you need to use Responsive Viewport Mode and set up your own device, update the screen resolution in the following properties: web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.width=1440 web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.height=900 The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 10. Run chrome in docker container confgiguraiton.profiles=web/docker,web/desktop/chrome Headless mode is a functionality that allows the execution of a full version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display, meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Update properties in this directory to adjust your headless automation. Contains phone related properties, for android and iOS devices, including portrait and landscape orientations. Profile Example of properties web/phone selenium.grid.capabilities.platform=Android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=11.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceOrientation=portrait selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=1.21.1 Similar to the Phone directory, but is designed for tablets properties. Profile Example of properties web/tablet selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=14.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceOrientation=landscape selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=1.21.1 Opens a new tab, switches to the opened tab and loads the given URL When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open Example 11. Open docs in a new tab.story When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new window Closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current window with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple windows open. Example 12. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new window When I close the current window Trying to close the current window with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current window was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new window. If you confirm window close in alert, the window will be closed, and you will need to switch to current window using the following step: When I switch to window with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 13. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new window When I click on element located `By.xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Stops page loading When I stop page loading Could be useful in combination with Selenium’s page load strategy Example 14. Stop page loading.story When I open URL `https://delayed.vividus.dev` in new window When I stop page loading Sets a custom page load timeout for a part of the story When I set page load timeout to `$duration` $duration - total duration to wait for page load completion in ISO-8601 format Example 15. Before loading a heavy page set an increased timeout Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I set page load timeout to `PT20S` When I open URL `https://example.com/super-heavy-page` in new window When I set page load timeout to `PT10S` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 16. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view. When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - Locator Example 17. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located `id(way_down_button)` into view Checks web performance metrics. Then metric $webPerformanceMetric is $comparisonRule `$duration` $webPerformanceMetric - The web performance metric. Where: TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE - The time between the navigation start and the response start. DNS_LOOKUP_TIME - The time between the domain lookup start and the domain lookup end. DOM_CONTENT_LOAD_TIME - The time between the DOM loading and the the DOM complete. PAGE_LOAD_TIME - The time between the navgation start and the load event end. $comparisonRule - The duration comparison rule. $duration - The duration to compare against in ISO-8601 format. Example 18. Check page load Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com' Then metric PAGE_LOAD_TIME is less than `PT5S` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Table 1. Possible actions type argument Argument example DOUBLE_CLICK Element locator or empty By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Element locator or empty By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text to type Minsk City CLICK Element locator or empty By.caseSensitiveText(Done) PRESS_KEYS Press and release any of Keys BACK_SPACE KEY_DOWN Press any of Keys one by one CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Release any of Keys one by one CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Element locator By.id(username) Example 19. Execute various web-actions When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | This step can be used to perform clipboard interactions. Example 20. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on Windows When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, CONTROL| Example 21. Paste text from the clipboard to the focused field on MacOS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |COMMAND, v| |KEY_UP |v, COMMAND| Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 22. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when locator’s visibility and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 23. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Waits for appearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 24. Wait for element appearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 25. Wait for element disappearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` disappears Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 26. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 27. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located `By.id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 28. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 29. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 30. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 31. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Validates the element located by the locator has existed for the period specified by the duration. The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration. Then element located `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - The Locator to find an element. $duration - The period of time the element should have existed in ISO-8601 format. Example 32. The element should have existed for 5 second Then element located `By.id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Example 33. Navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `1` When I navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `0` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order. The collection should have more than 1 element with not empty text, otherwise the step fails. Then elements located `$locator` are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order $locator - Locator. $sortingOrder Plain Readable Description ASCENDING ascending Verify that elements are sorted in ascending order DESCENDING descending Verify that elements are sorted in descending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_ASCENDING case-insensitive ascending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive ascending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_DESCENDING case-insensitive descending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive descending order Example 34. Check items are sorted Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://grocery.by' When I click on element located `By.id(a-z)` Then elements located `By.xpath(//span[@id='item-to-purchase'])` are sorted by text in ascending order Takes a screenshot and publish it to the report. When I take screenshot Takes a screenshot and saves it to the default folder defined by user. The full path to a screenshot will be posted to logs and allure When I take screenshot and save it to folder `$path` $path - The absolute or relative path to the folder to save taken screenshot. Example 35. Take a screenshot to a path When I take screenshot and save it to folder `${screenshot-directory}/#{generate(Ancient.god)}.png` Scan a barcode and save its value to the variable with the specified name. Only the first founded barcode will be scanned.

It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. Learn more. You can run VIVIDUS automated scenarios on mobile devices using Appium tool. Since Appium has a Client/Server Architecture, it is required to install and run Appium server to perform mobile tests. There are two ways of installing Appium server: Application installation (Appium Desktop) Appium Desktop is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any platform. It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server, so you don’t need to worry about Node. Download the latest version of Appium Desktop. Command line installation Appium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed from source or installed directly from NPM: npm install -g appium To run Appium use the command: appium Make sure you have installed: Java Android SDK Xcode (iOS) And the following environment variables are set: JAVA_HOME ANDROID_HOME You can open \"Edit configuration\" to set the variables in Appium Desktop. Read more details for basic Android and iOS setup in Appium Guide. Appium-Doctor diagnoses, reports and fixes common Node, iOS and Android configuration issues before starting Appium. It helps to make sure you have everything to start using Appium. Appium-doctor checks for: Android: Android sdk exists and configured properly; Environment variables and path check; iOS: XCode is installed (with command line tools); Dev tools security check; Auth check; Node binary check; Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and values that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that tell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required capabilities for any Appium driver should include: platformName: the name of the platform to automate platformVersion: the version of the platform to automate deviceName: the kind of device to automate app: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the browserName capability instead in the case of automating a web browser) automationName: the name of the driver you wish to use There are lots of other capabilities. To find out more please see Appium Capabilities Doc. Before running VIVIDUS scenarios it is necessary to pass Desired Capabilities to Appium Server. Use them as properties with selenium.grid.capabilities. prefix. Then just put these capabilities into the appropriate *.properties file. Please see examples below: Example 1. iOS properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=15.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.ipa Example 2.

See the relevant sections for defining these properties for iOS and Android Appium Inspector is basically just an Appium client with a user interface. It allows to interact with application elements and Appium commands in a user friendly way. You can get the latest version of Inspector application following the link. Click to view capabilities set up in Inspector VIVIDUS Sample Tests is a GitHub repository. Its puropose is to demo VIVIDUS capabilities via sample tests. Let’s use it as an example for running mobile tests via Appium. Assumptions You have installed and properly set up the following: IDE Appium Server AVD Manager (Android) Simulator application (iOS) Cloning and importing the repository Clone vividus-sample-tests project using the following command: git clone --recursive git@github.com:vividus-framework/vividus-sample-tests.git Then use this detailed guide to proceed with importing and building the project. Overriding properties Since we are only interested in the mobile application story, add the following properties to the overriding.properties file. Choose one of the platforms and make sure properties match with your simulator set up. Click to expand overriding.properties Example 3.

Click to view screenshots Appium-Desktop Appium in the terminal Tests execution and expected results Execute the test either via ./gradlew runStories command or by clicking the Run button in the IDE. In case everything has been set up correctly you will see the following: Appium creates a new session; Testing application (Swag Labs Mobile) is installed on the simulator; Application is started; Credentials are entered into username and password fields; After successful login user sees the landing page; Executing tests on real devices has some features and required different preparations depending on the platform. Firstly, make sure you have installed Android Debug Bridge. Simply enter in the command line adb --version. You should get some adb information in the output: adb --version Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 Version 31.0.3-7562133 Installed as /usr/local/bin/adb Connect the device you want to interact with to your workstation. Use adb devices command to see the list of connected devices: adb devices List of devices attached UKjeCe9Mr9 device In this example UKjeCe9Mr9 is the unique identifier of the device. Use that number as a udid capability (property) in VIVIDUS: selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=UKjeCe9Mr9 You are ready to run tests! Just add this property to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Emulators Automating a real device with XCUITest Driver(iOS) is considerably more complicated, due to Apple’s restrictions around running apps on real devices. XCUITest driver installs a helper application called WebDriverAgent-Runner onto the device, and handles the application under test via it. While this is simple in theory, the hoops of code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can make this a bit of a headache. There are two approaches for WebDriverAgent configuration: Automatic WDA configuration. Proper work of the WDA requires signing it with a valid Apple Developer account. If you have a paid Apple Developer account, please see the following instructions on Appium Doc; Manual WDA configuration. Using a \"Free\" developer account often leads to issues with the impossibility of creating a wildcard provisioning profile for the default application bundle. Follow the instructions below to handle this issue. The next steps are based on Appium manual configuration doc. Add a new Apple Development Certificate for your Apple ID; Click to see details Open Xcode and go to settings Click \"+\" to add an account and then Sign In with your Apple ID Add a new Apple Development Certificate Build WebDriverAgent signed with your newly created certificate; Open WDA project in Xcode; Most common path to the project: /Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj Come up with your unique Bundle Identifier. Use it for updating build parameters.

For the first time, Appium will install the WDA application on the Apple device. Since WDA is signed with an unknown Apple Developer account, we need to add it to the trust. Start the session either via Appium Inspector or by running an autotest. Once the WDA icon appears on the screen, do the following: Go to Settings→General→Profile & Device Management (iOS 15 and higher - Settings→General→VPN & Device Management); Tap on \"Apple Development: \"account name\"; Choose \"Trust\"; Click to view screenshot You are ready to run tests! Just add properties from above to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Simulators Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Make sure adb sees the device (adb devices). In case the device is not on the list, try restarting adb server via terminal: adb kill-server && \\ adb start-server WDA is expired. This is the most common issue that appeared on iOS devices Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65 When it happens, the icon of the WebDriverAgent disappears from the device menu. To get it back on the device you should rebuild WDA for your device and add your developer account to trust again; Use this guide to fix WDA expiration much faster Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Yes. You can create the second application signed with your Apple Developer account. Once WebDriverAgent get expired, it will be deleted. But your second app will remain on the device and keep your Apple Developer account in the trusted list. You will only need to rebuild WDA in a click to get it back. Click to expand steps Make sure your device is connected to your workstation; Open Xcode and create a new project; Choose Application type \"App\" for your platform; Enter Product Name, let’s say \"keeper\"; Use the same Team and Organization Identifier that you used for WebDriverAgent; Click Build; Now your mobile device has the keeper application installed. It will remain on the device even when WDA is deleted due to expiration. When it happens, just connect the device, open the WDA project and click build. After the build is successful you can start your Appium sessions again. Make sure your computer and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-FI network.; On Apple TV go to Settings→Remotes and Devices→Remote App and Devices; On your Mac open Xcode→Window→Devices and Simulators (⌘+2); Click \" + \" on the tab \"Devices\" to add a new device.; Choose your Apple TV from the list; Enter the 6-digit passcode that appeared on the TV screen;","title":"Appium Setup","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"appium-setup","url":"/vividus/latest/user-guides/appium-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Intro","hash":"_intro","id":1},{"text":"Install Appium server","hash":"_install_appium_server","id":2},{"text":"Environment setup","hash":"_environment_setup","id":3},{"text":"Appium-Doctor (Optional)","hash":"_appium_doctor_optional","id":4},{"text":"Appium Capabilities","hash":"_appium_capabilities","id":5},{"text":"Setting capabilities in VIVIDUS","hash":"_setting_capabilities_in_vividus","id":6},{"text":"Basic properties","hash":"_basic_properties","id":7},{"text":"Real devices properties","hash":"_real_devices_properties","id":8},{"text":"Appium Inspector (Optional)","hash":"_appium_inspector_optional","id":9},{"text":"Running tests on Simulator/Emulator","hash":"_running_tests_on_simulatoremulator","id":10},{"text":"Running tests on Real Devices","hash":"_running_tests_on_real_devices","id":11},{"text":"Android","hash":"_android","id":12},{"text":"Android device UDID","hash":"_android_device_udid","id":13},{"text":"iOS","hash":"_ios","id":14},{"text":"WDA configuration","hash":"_wda_configuration","id":15},{"text":"Manual WDA configuration","hash":"_manual_wda_configuration","id":16},{"text":"Define properties for running a real apple device","hash":"_define_properties_for_running_a_real_apple_device","id":17},{"text":"First start","hash":"_first_start","id":18},{"text":"F.A.Q.","hash":"_f_a_q","id":19},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an Android device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_android_device","id":20},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an iOS device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_ios_device","id":21},{"text":"It’s quite unhandy to add an Apple Developer account to trusted every time WDA is expired.

The database is deployed on tests start, accessible from tests and shutdown on tests end. The test data can be created from SQL files located in the project. Add the required dependencies (DB plugin, H2 database) to the project build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.5.0-SNAPSHOT') implementation(group: 'com.h2database', name: 'h2', version: '2.1.214') Configure connection to the H2 database and initialization DDL/DQL scripts could be run using either INIT property of the connection string or the step executing SQL queries. Whichever method of database initialization is chosen, RUNSCRIPT statement with the path to SQL files could be used. Here you can specify absolute path to file or use the 'classpath:/' prefix - files will be searched from 'src/main/resources' folder relatively. The details on executing SQL statements on connection could be found in the official H2 guide. 2.1 Configure using INIT property using INIT property data loaded into the database once and can no longer be change. Example 1. Configure connection and initialization of the database db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ INIT=create schema if not exists test\\\\;\\ SET SCHEMA test\\\\;\\ DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.students\\\\;\\ CREATE TABLE test.students (firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)\\\\;\\ INSERT INTO students (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Maria', 'Miller')\\\\; db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= Example 2. Configure connection and initialization of the database with RUNSCRIPT db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ INIT=create schema if not exists test\\\\;\\ SET SCHEMA test\\\\;\\ RUNSCRIPT FROM 'classpath:/path/to/sql/file1.sql'\\\\;\\ RUNSCRIPT FROM 'classpath:/path/to/sql/file2.sql' db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= 2.2 Configure using test step if you use database initialization in the step, you only need to specify the connection parameters in the properties file and execute DDL script in the test. Example 3. Configure connection to database db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1; db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= If you are using database initialization in the step, do not forget to set the property DB_CLOSE_DELAY. Example 4. Initialization of the database When I execute SQL query ` CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS test; SET SCHEMA test; CREATE TABLE test.students (firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL); INSERT INTO students (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Maria', 'Miller'); ` against `testh2db` Example 5. Initialization of the database with RUNSCRIPT When I execute SQL query ` CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS test; SET SCHEMA test; RUNSCRIPT FROM 'classpath:/path/to/sql/file1.sql'; RUNSCRIPT FROM 'classpath:/path/to/sql/file2.sql' ` against `testh2db` Use the configured connection and the initialized database to execute SQL Example 6. Execute SQL script against H2 database When I execute SQL query ` SELECT * FROM students ` against `testh2db` and save result to scenario variable `h2-records` Example 7. Execute DML script against H2 database initialized in the step with the schema test and check result When I execute SQL query ` INSERT INTO test.students (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Alex', 'Magnus'); ` against `testh2db` When I execute SQL query ` UPDATE test.students SET firstname='Mary' WHERE lastname='Miller'; ` against `testh2db` When I execute SQL query ` SELECT * FROM test.students ` against `testh2db` and save result to scenario variable `h2-records` Then `${h2-records}` is equal to `[{FIRSTNAME=Mary, LASTNAME=Miller}, {FIRSTNAME=Alex, LASTNAME=Magnus}]`","title":"How to use in-memory database to manage test
