Synonyms: VIVIDUS expression. An expression is a special placeholder which is detected, evaluated and resolved during test execution. Expressions are used for the data generation and transformation. General expression syntax is: #{expression} During resolution process the expression placeholder is replaced with the result of the expression evaluation. If expression is unknown for VIVIDUS, the placeholder will be kept as is. If expression evaluation results in error, it will be propagated to the top level and the test will be marked as broken. It’s allowed to construct nested expressions: in this case the evaluation starts with the deepest expression. Expressions may include any number of variables placeholders. Synonyms: project resource, test resource. A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExampleTable transformer. ExampleTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\. Example 1. Escaping special characters in transformer properties {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER, countries=\\{Australia\\,Canada\\}} In the example above the transformer will have a single property with name countries and value {Australia,Canada}. VIVIDUS variables of scopes global and next batches can be used in transformer properties (pay attention to escapes of the variables placeholders in the example below). Example 2.

There are a few steps to achieve this: Configure link pattern via properties. Example 1. Configure link to issue tracking system in environment.properties system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{} Add meta tags to the story/scenario meta. Example 2. Story level meta-tag containing ID of the issue Meta: @issueId VVD-1 Scenario: Should check variables equals Then `1` is = `1` Run tests and explore the links in the report. Property name Meta tag Description Example system.allure.link.issue.pattern @issueId Issue link pattern https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/{} system.allure.link.requirement.pattern @requirementId Requirement link pattern https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/{} system.allure.link.tms.pattern @testCaseId Test case link pattern https://vividus.jira.com/issues/{} It is possible to configure linking to multiple systems of the same type. To achieve this user should define a custom suffix for the properties and meta tags. Example 3. Configure links to several issue tracking systems in environment.properties # Default property system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.prod/issues/{} # Additional property with .dev suffix, that used to create links annotated with @isssueId.dev system.allure.link.issue.dev.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{} Example 4. Story level meta-tags containing IDs of the issues belonging to different systems Meta: @issueId VVD-1 @issueId.dev DEV-1 Scenario: Should check variables equal Then `1` is = `1` VIVIDUS can send notifications with test execution summary upon test completion. The following table defines a set of common properties that may be used to generate notification data. All properties are optional, in case if property is not set, no corresponding data will be added to the notification. Property name Description Example notifications.base.project Project name (e.g. abbreviation, code or full descriptive name) vividus-tests notifications.base.environment Test execution environment, by default it’s mapped to configuration.environments property web/qa notifications.base.comment Any comment to add Smoke tests notifications.base.report-link URL of the report https://my-jenkins.com/build/123/report VIVIDUS can send e-mail notifications via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The following properties are used configure notification sending. The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property name Description Example notifications.mail.host The SMTP server to connect to smtp.gmail.com notifications.mail.port The SMTP server port to connect to 465 notifications.mail.username User name for SMTP connection iamvividus@gmail.com notifications.mail.password The user’s password abcdefghijklmnop notifications.mail.from The envelope return address iamvividus@gmail.com notifications.mail.recipient Comma-separated set the recipient addresses dl@my-company.com, test-results@my-company.com notifications.mail.enable-ssl If set to true, use SSL to connect true","title":"Reporting Configuration","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"reporting","url":"/vividus/latest/reporting.html","titles":[{"text":"Add external links to report","hash":"_add_external_links_to_report","id":1},{"text":"System types","hash":"_system_types","id":2},{"text":"Multiple external systems","hash":"_multiple_external_systems","id":3},{"text":"Notifications","hash":"_notifications","id":4},{"text":"Base configuration","hash":"_base_configuration","id":5},{"text":"E-mail","hash":"_e_mail","id":6}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"VIVIDUS configuration includes the following parts: profiles, environments and suites. Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued. The following properties are used to configure batches (VIVIDUS doesn’t provide any default batch configuration out of the box). batch-number is one-based batch index. The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property Default value Description bdd.story-loader.batch-.resource-location The test project path to the folder with story-files bdd.story-loader.batch-.resource-include-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be included in the batch. Leading and trailing whitespaces in patterns are omitted. bdd.story-loader.batch-.resource-exclude-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be excluded from the batch. Leading and trailing whitespaces in patterns are omitted. bdd.batch-.name batch- The name of the batch to display in the report bdd.batch-.threads 1 The number of parallel threads used to run stories bdd.batch-.meta-filters suite meta-filter The meta-filter used to filter the batch stories and scenarios bdd.batch-.fail-fast false If true and any failure is occurred during the batch execution, the subsequent batches will not be executed. bdd.batch-.story-execution-timeout PT3H The max duration of the single story in the batch. bdd.batch.fail-fast false If set to true the subsequent batches execution will be stopped after first failed assertion bdd.story.fail-fast false If set to true the story execution will be stopped after first failed assertion bdd.scenario.fail-fast false If set to true the scenario execution will be stopped after first failed assertion bdd.configuration.dry-run false Enables dry-run execution mode (no actual steps will be executed, dynamic variables and expressions won’t be resolved). For example dry-run could be useful to debug what stroies will be executed with provided config. bdd.configuration.skip-story-if-given-story-failed false Skips the story in case of failure in the given story statistics.print-failures false If set to true prints table of failures including: story, scenario, step and error message report.text-length-diff-threshold 100 Defines text threshold length to enable unified diff report publishing on failure, for variable comparisons. If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 2. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 3. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @severity 1 @layout desktop Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.epam.com/' Then the page title is equal to 'EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting' Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @severity 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.google.com/' Then the page title is equal to 'Google' The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 4. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 5. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 6. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 7. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @severity Numeric values (range 1-5) Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important Test, the highest number is the least important. @severity 1 @layout desktop, phone, phone_portrait, phone_landscape, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet, tablet_landscape, tablet_portrait Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop @browserWindowSize Any browser window size in pixels, e.g. 800x600. Note: browser window size should be smaller than the current screen resolution. This meta tag is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.5.0. The replacement is the step resizing browser window. Used to specify browser window size. It can be applied on both story and scenario levels. In case, if browser size differs between adjacent scenarios, browser window will be simply resized to desired values, browser session will not be restarted. If the tag is not set for story or scenario, the browser window will be maximized to the screen size during local test execution. @browserWindowSize 1024x768 In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 8. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 9. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task By default all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However it might be required to map certain values to null-s. It can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all RED 3 Test report isn’t generated RED Here one could find description of general HTTP properties applied across all the HTTP interactions in VIVIDUS. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description General http.circular-redirects-allowed boolean false Allow circular redirects (redirects to the same location) http.connection-request-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the client connections pool. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.connect-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.max-total-connections integer 80 The number of maximum total connections for the client connections pool http.max-connections-per-route integer 60 The number of maximum connections per route for the client connections pool http.socket-timeout integer 3000 The timeout in milliseconds used for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.cookie-spec default, ignoreCookies, standard-strict, standard, netscape default The name of the cookie specification to be used for HTTP state management Authentication Property Name Acceptable values Default Description http.auth.username character sequence The username, presence of this property requires the http.auth.password to be also set http.auth.password character sequence The password, presence of this property requires the http.auth.username to be also set http.auth.preemptive-auth-enabled boolean false If enabled the HTTP client will send the basic authentication data even before the service gives an unauthorized response (401), useful when the service doesn’t support unauthorized response (401) or to reduce the overhead of making the connection SSL handshake http.ssl.check-certificate boolean true Verify certificates sent by the server during SSL handshake, the most common errors occured during verfication are Expired SSL Certificate Error, SSL Certificate Not Trusted Error, SSL Certificate Revoked Error etc. http.ssl.verify-hostname boolean true Verify if the domain name in the SSL certificate matches the domain name in URL where the request is sent to Two-Way SSL authentication http.key-store.type KeyStore types JKS The key store type http.key-store.path Resource The key store to load http.key-store.password string The password used to unlock the key store and for the integrity checking http.ssl.private-key-password string The password for the private key DNS resolver http.local-dns-storage. key-value mapping The property prefix used to override the OS DNS lookup by specifying hostname to IP address mappings e.g. http.local-dns-storage.coursera.org=52.84.197.20 Service unavailability retry handler http.service-unavailable-retry.max-retries integer 1 The maximum number of allowed retries if the server responds with a HTTP code specified in http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes property http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes set of integers The set of HTTP status codes to be retried. If it’s empty, no retries will be performed http.service-unavailable-retry.retry-interval ISO-8601 duration PT1S The retry interval between subsequent requests Idempotent retry handler http.idempotent-methods-sending-request-body set of integers The list of HTTP methods containing request body which should be treated as idempotent for retries Most common use cases for externalized configuration are tests parametrization with properties passed from CI/CD pipeline, passing of secrets into test run etc. The available approaches are listed below. Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value bdd.variables.global.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.bdd.variables.global.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.bdd.variables.global.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. Generate the overriding.properties file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project. The following script assumes that we are in the root of the test project folder. cat > src/main/resources/overriding.properties << EOD bdd.variables.global.some-key-1=value1 bdd.variables.global.some-key-2=value2 EOD This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. VIVIDUS allows to store values of the properties in the encrypted form. VIVIDUS uses Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) which provides two-way encryption mechanism. While performing two-way encryption, apart from feeding plain-text it’s required to feed the secret text (i.e. password) and this secret text is used to decrypt the encrypted text. The default encryption algorithm is PBEWithMD5AndDES. Download the latest Jasypt release Unpack the downloaded zip-archive Go to bin folder Run the command perfoming encryption: Example 10. Windows: encrypt.bat input=\"This is my message to be encrypted\" password=MYPAS_WORD Example 11. Linux/UNIX/macOS: ./encrypt.sh input=\"This is my message to be encrypted\" password=MYPAS_WORD where input - Any string to be encrypted. password - Your encryption password. MYPAS_WORD is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption. Find the encrypted data in OUTPUT section Example 12. Encryption command output ----ENVIRONMENT----------------- Runtime: Eclipse Adoptium OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17+35 ----ARGUMENTS------------------- input: This is my message to be encrypted password: MYPAS_WORD ----OUTPUT---------------------- WVnXhzG704KRZZFYL7hfpA4YoSm8V2F5eNXyr7CRYCichteHvNS3nB23zaI8CuLy Find more details in Jasypt CLI Tools documentation Use this tool at your own risk, since there is a chance of potential leakage of sensitive data Paste plain text string to encrypt to the corresponding text field. Set Type of Encryption to \"Two Way Encryption (With Secret Text)\". Enter secret key/text in the corresponding text field. Click \"Encrypt\". The resulting encrypted string can be copied from the corresponding field. Add the secret key/text to the project properties as the value of: system.vividus.encryptor.password=MYPAS_WORD This value must be kept secret and must not be committed to version control system. MYPAS_WORD is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption. Use the wrapping ENC(…​) for any encrypted property value. e.g. http.auth.password=ENC(WVnXhzG704KRZZFYL7hfpA4YoSm8V2F5eNXyr7CRYCichteHvNS3nB23zaI8CuLy) Please see Externalized Configuration to find the ways how encryptor password can be passed to the tests. VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let’s take the following step: Example 13. VIVIDUS step When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` Create a new JSON file (for example, aliases/aliases.json) and put the following content with one or more aliases: Example 14. aliases/aliases.json [ { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`\", \"aliases\": [ { \"name\": \"When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `$locator`\" }, { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse pointer over web element located `$locator`\" } ] } ] Point the alias configuration property to an exact location or location pattern with the JSON files containing ailases: engine.alias-paths=aliases/aliases.json Use the defned alias in place of actual step in your story When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `id(loginButton)`","title":"Tests Configuration","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"tests-configuration","url":"/vividus/latest/tests-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"configuration.properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":1},{"text":"Suites","hash":"_suites","id":2},{"text":"Known Issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":3},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":4},{"text":"Known Issues file","hash":"_known_issues_file","id":5},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":6},{"text":"Meta tags","hash":"_meta_tags","id":7},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":8},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_2","id":9},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":10},{"text":"1D tags (@key)","hash":"_1d_tags_key","id":11},{"text":"2D tags (@key  value)","hash":"_2d_tags_key_value","id":12},{"text":"Story Prioritization","hash":"_story_prioritization","id":13},{"text":"ExamplesTable","hash":"_examplestable","id":14},{"text":"Mapping values to null-s","hash":"_mapping_values_to_null_s","id":15},{"text":"Exit codes","hash":"_exit_codes","id":16},{"text":"HTTP Configuration","hash":"_http_configuration","id":17},{"text":"Externalized Configuration","hash":"_externalized_configuration","id":18},{"text":"Sensitive Data Encryption","hash":"_sensitive_data_encryption","id":19},{"text":"How to encrypt a string","hash":"_how_to_encrypt_a_string","id":20},{"text":"Option 1 (Recommended): using Jasypt CLI","hash":"_option_1_recommended_using_jasypt_cli","id":21},{"text":"Option 2: using Jasypt Online","hash":"_option_2_using_jasypt_online","id":22},{"text":"How to use an encrypted string in VIVIDUS","hash":"_how_to_use_an_encrypted_string_in_vividus","id":23},{"text":"Steps aliases","hash":"_steps_aliases","id":24},{"text":"How to use steps aliases","hash":"_how_to_use_steps_aliases","id":25}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"via GIPHY","title":"The page is under construction","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"under-construction","url":"/vividus/latest/under-construction.html","titles":[]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"In scope of this article the task term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities and that produces some output based on the work done.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regaular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story. Variables are invalidated once the story is completed. next_batches Variables are available in the next batches. next_batches-scoped variable is not available in batch it’s declared within. global Such variables are declared only via properties with bdd.variables.global. prefix and available throughout the entire execution. An attempt to create the globally scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 1. Declaring global variable login-endpoint bdd.variables.global.login-endpoint=https://my-auth-server.com/api/login Example 2. Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I issue a HTTP POST request for a resource with the URL '${login-endpoint}' Then the response code is equal to '200' It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 3. Declaring global variable with expression random-user bdd.variables.global.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 4. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I issue a HTTP POST request for a resource with the URL '/authenticate' Then the response code is equal to '200' Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 5. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario When I initialize the scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` When I initialize the story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario.","title":"Variables","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"variables","url":"/vividus/latest/commons/variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution","id":1},{"text":"Regular variables","hash":"_regular_variables","id":2},{"text":"Scopes","hash":"_scopes","id":3},{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution_2","id":4}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Here one could find description of the steps that are delivered with Vividus itself without any plugins required.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

Download S3 object When I fetch object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `my-json-var` Set the canned access control list (ACL) for the specified object in Amazon S3. Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy. When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error. When I set ACL `$cannedAcl` for object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` $cannedAcl - The new pre-configured canned ACL for the specified object.

When I $queueOperation consumed `$consumerKey` Kafka messages to $scopes variable `$variableName` $queueOperation - DRAIN - saves the messages consumed since the last drain or from the consumption start and moves the consumer cursor to the position after the last consumed message, PEEK - saves the messages consumed since the last drain or from the consumption start and doesn’t change the consumer cursor position $consumerKey - the key of the Kafka consumer configuration $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - the variable name to store the messages. The messages are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received message. Waits until the count of the consumed messaged (from the consumer start or after the last draining operation) matches to the rule or until the timeout is exceeded. When I wait with `$timeout` timeout until count of consumed `$consumerKey` Kafka messages is $comparisonRule `$expectedCount` $timeout - the maximum time to wait for the messages in ISO-8601 format $consumerKey - the key of the Kafka consumer configuration $comparisonRule - the comparison rule $expectedCount - the expected count of the messages to be matched by the rule Stops the Kafka consumer started by the corresponding step before. All recorded messages are kept and can be drained into the variable using the step described above. When I stop consuming messages from `$consumerKey` Kafka $consumerKey - the key of the Kafka consumer configuration Example 3. Consume messages from the Kafka topic When I start consuming messages from `dev` Kafka topics `my-topic-1, my-topic-2` !-- Perform any actions triggering the publishing of messages to Kafka When I wait with `PT30S` timeout until count of consumed `dev` Kafka messages is greater than `1` When I stop consuming messages from `dev` Kafka When I drain consumed Kafka messages to scenario variable `consumed-messages` Then `${consumed-messages[0]}` is equal to `some-expected-message` Example 4. Drain messages while listener is rinning When I start consuming messages from `prod` Kafka topics `my-topic-1, my-topic-2` !-- Perform any actions triggering the publishing of messages to Kafka When I drain consumed `prod` Kafka messages to scenario variable `messages-after-action-X` !-- Perform more actions triggering the publishing of messages to Kafka When I drain consumed `prod` Kafka messages to scenario variable `messages-after-action-Y` When I stop consuming messages from `prod` Kafka Example 5.

The property value may vary depending on test cloud providers and can be found in the XCode logs. ${clipboard-text} Example 6. Verify clipboard content Then `${clipboard-text}` is equal to `uarlouski@gmail.com` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 7. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 8. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Given I start mobile application Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides gloablly-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilies have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 9. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 10. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 11. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 12. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The settings to set. Example 13. Configure to show invisible elements When I change Appium session settings: |name |value| |allowInvisibleElements|true | Uploads a file to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. Example 14. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image This step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.5.0. The replacement is Switch to Web view by name. Switches context to a web view by the index, it starts from 1 (see Automating hybrid apps for more information). When I switch to web view with index `$index` $index - The index of the web view. Example 15. Switch to web view by index Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I switch to web view with index `1` Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Switches context to a web view with name that matches the rule (see Automating hybrid apps for more information). Also Appium capabilities for iOS and Android are available for the fine-tuning configuration. When I switch to web view with name that $comparisonRule `$value` $comparisonRule - The web view name comparison rule. $value - The value to find the target web view. Example 16. Switch to web view by name Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I switch to web view with name that contains `vividustestapp` Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Switches context to a mobile native context. See Automating hybrid apps for more information. When I switch to native context Example 17. Switch to native context Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I switch to native context Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Taps on the element located by the locator. The atomic actions performed are: * press on the element; * release. When I tap on element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 18. Tap on element When I tap on element located `accessibilityId(menu-toggler)` Taps on the element located by the locator with the specified duration. The atomic actions performed are: * press on the element; * wait for the duration; * release. When I tap on element located `$locator` with duration `$duration` $locator - Locator. $duration - The duration between an element is pressed and released in ISO-8601 format. Example 19.

Type text and keep keyboard opened When I type `Bob` in field located `accessibilityId(username)` and keep keyboard opened Clears the field located by the locator. The atomic actions performed are: * clear the field; * hide keyboard. For iOS real devices the hide keyboard action works only for XCUIElementTypeTextField elements and skipped for XCUIElementTypeTextView elements, in case of XCUIElementTypeTextView element tap outside the text view is performed to close the keyboard. When I clear field located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 26. Clear the field When I clear field located `accessibilityId(username)` Only clears the field located by the locator. The keyboard hiding is skipped. When I clear field located `$locator` and keep keyboard open $locator - Locator. Example 27. Clear text and keep keyboard open When I clear field located `accessibilityId(username)` and keep keyboard open Swipes to an element in either UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT direction with the specified swipe duration. The step takes into account the current context. If you need to perform swipe on the element, you need to switch the context to this element. mobile-application.swipe.limit - defines max numbers of swipes to perform (if it’s reached the swipe process is stopped and the error is thrown) mobile-application.swipe.stabilization-duration - defines a duration to wait after swipe until view becomes stable mobile-application.swipe.vertical.x-position - defines a vertical swipe x axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to x=1 and 100 corresponds to x = mobile screen width - 1, default value is 0 mobile-application.swipe.horizontal.y-position - defines a horizontal swipe y axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to y=1 and 100 corresponds to y = mobile screen height - 1, default value is 50 When I swipe $direction to element located `$locator` with duration $swipeDuration $direction - The direction to swipe: UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. $locator - Locator. $swipeDuration - The swipe duration in ISO-8601 format. Example 28. Swipe to an element Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `0` When I swipe UP to element located `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `1` Example 29. Swipe the context element Scenario: Switch slides When I change context to element located `accessibilityId(carousel)` Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `0` When I swipe LEFT to element located `accessibilityId(slide 2)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `1` Selects a next or previous picker wheel value in date picker Only iOS platform is supported. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypePickerWheel. When I select $direction value with `$offset` offset in picker wheel located `$locator` $direction - The direction to search the value: NEXT or PREVIOUS. $offset - The ofset to pick from a middle of the wheel, see Select Picker Wheel Value guide. $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypePickerWheel element. Example 30. Select next item in the picker wheel When I select next value with `0.1` offset in picker wheel located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypePickerWheel)->filter.index(3)` Records performance metrics of iOS application. It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 31. Perform profiling during application usage When I start recording `Time Profiler` metrics !-- set of actions to measure performance When I stop recording `Time Profiler` metrics and save results to file `${outputDirectory}/time_profiler.zip` Sets the slider value in percents. The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypeSlider. The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively. When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypeSlider element. $percent - The target value of the slider in percents. Example 32. Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `90` percents Example 33. Set value of iOS slider (with range -50:50) to 20 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `70` percents Example 34. Set value of iOS slider (with range 18:65) to 55 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range. The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations. The target element must be of type android.widget.SeekBar. The number must be greater than or equal to 0. Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure. When I set value of Android slider located `$locator` to `$number` $locator - The locator to find android.widget.SeekBar element. $number - The number to set on the slider Example 35. Set value of Android slider (with range 0:50) to 13 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `13` Example 36. Set value of Android slider (with range -50:50) to -25 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `25` Example 37. Set value of Android slider (with range 18:65) to 20 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `2` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 38. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when locator’s visibility and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 39. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Waits for appearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 40.

When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 41. Wait for element disappearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` disappears Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 42. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 43. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located `By.id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 44. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 45. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 46. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 47. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Verifies that an element located by locator exists for given duration. Then element located `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - Locator. $duration - The duration in ISO-8601 format. Example 48. Element should exists for 5 second Then element located `id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Example 49. Navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `1` When I navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `0` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order.

Example 10. Set ExamplesTable HTTP request body Given form data request: |name |value | |firstName|Ivan | |lastName |Ivanov | |password |!@3qwer| Adds HTTP headers to the HTTP request. When I add request headers:$headers headers - ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns name and value specifying HTTP header Example 11. Add request header with name Accept-Language and value en-ru When I add request headers: |name |value | |Accept-Language|en-ru | When I send HTTP GET to the relative URL '/get?name=Content' Then a JSON element by the JSON path '$.headers.Accept-Language' is equal to '\"en-ru\"' Executes the HTTP request to access a resource on the server identified by the URL. The step uses previously set HTTP headers and request body. The response HTTP headers, response status code and response body can be accessed by the corresponding steps and dynamic variables. When I execute HTTP $httpMethod request for resource with URL `$url` $httpMethod - The HTTP method. $url - The URL of the resource on the server. Example 12. Execute HTTP GET request When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Waits for a specified amount of time until HTTP response body contains an element by the specified JSON path. The actions of the step: Execute sub-steps. Check if the HTTP response is present and the response body contains an element by JSON path. If the required JSON element exists or the maximum number of retries is reached, then the execution stops, otherwise the step actions are repeated. Stop step execution if HTTP response is not present or JSON element is found, otherwise sleep for the calculated part of specified duration and repeat actions from the start. When I wait for presence of element by `$jsonPath` for `$duration` duration retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute $jsonPath - The JSON path of the element to find. $duration - The time duration to wait in ISO-8601 format. $retryTimes - The maximum of attempts. duration/retryTimes = timeout is a polling timeout between requests. $stepsToExecute - The sub-steps to execute at each iteration. Example 13. Wait for presence of element 10 times with polling timeout between requests 5 seconds When I wait for presence of element by `$.unstableElement` for `PT50S` duration retrying 10 times |step | |When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `http://example.com/testing-page` | Executes the provided sub-steps until the HTTP response body contains an element by the specified JSON path or the maximum number of retries is reached. The maximum duration of the step execution is not limited. The actions of the step: execute sub-steps wait the polling interval if the required JSON element exists or the maximum number of retries is reached, then the execution stops, otherwise the step actions are repeated When I wait for presence of element by `$jsonPath` with `$pollingInterval` polling interval retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute jsonPath - the JSON path of the element to find pollingInterval - the duration to wait between retries retryTimes - the maximum number of the retries stepsToExecute - the sub-steps to execute at each iteration Example 14.

Then server `$hostname` supports secure protocols that $rule `$protocols` $hostname - the server hostname $rule - the collection comparison rule $protocols - the secure protocols that are expected to match specified $rule Example 15. Validate the server supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 protocols Then server `vividus-test-site.herokuapp.com` supports secure protocols that contain `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3` Waits for the specified number of times until HTTP response code is equal to the expected one. In case if the expected code is not returned after all retries, the assertion error will be recorded. When I wait for response code $responseCode for $duration duration retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute $responseCode - The expected HTTP status code. $duration - The time duration to wait in ISO-8601 format. $retryTimes - The number of times the request will be retried: duration/retryTimes = timeout is a polling timeout between requests. $stepsToExecute - The steps to execute at each wait iteration. Example 16. Wait until HTTP GET request returns status code 200 When I wait for response code `200` for `PT10S` duration retrying 3 times |step | |When I send HTTP GET to the relative URL '/delayed-resource'| Checks content type of HTTP response body matches to the specified expected content type according to the provided string validation rule. Then content type of response body $comparisonRule `$contentType` $comparisonRule - String validation rule. $contentType – Expected content type, e.g. text/html, application/xml, application/json. Example 17. Submit a GET request and check that response body type is application/json When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then content type of response body is equal to `application/json` Compare size of decompressed HTTP response body with the specified expected size in bytes. Then size of decompressed response body is $comparisonRule `$sizeInBytes` $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $sizeInBytes - The expected size of the response body in bytes. Example 18. Submit a GET request and check that response body size is greater or equal to 1200 bytes When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Then size of decompressed response body is greater than or equal to `1200` Saves specified archive entries into varaibles. When I save content of `$archiveData` archive entries to variables:$parameters $archiveData - The archive data to verify. $parameters - The ExampleTable that contains specified string comparison path, variableName, scopes, outputFormat. Available columns: path - The path to the archive entry. variable - The name of variable to save the data. scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. outputFormat - Defines output format of the entriy, either TEXT or BASE64.

The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access height and width of the browser window. Variable name Description browser-window-height the height of the browser window browser-window-width the width of the browser window Example 6. Check the dimension of the browser window When I change window size to `800x600` Then `${browser-window-width}` is = `800` Then `${browser-window-height}` is = `600` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 7. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 8. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 9. Run chrome in docker container confgiguraiton.profiles=web/docker,web/desktop/chrome Opens a new tab, switches to the opened tab and loads the given URL When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open Example 10. Open docs in a new tab.story When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new window Closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current window with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple windows open. Example 11. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new window When I close the current window Trying to close the current window with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current window was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new window. If you confirm window close in alert, the window will be closed, and you will need to switch to current window using the following step: When I switch to window with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 12. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new window When I click on element located `By.xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Stops page loading When I stop page loading Could be useful in combination with Selenium’s page load strategy Example 13. Stop page loading.story When I open URL `https://delayed.vividus.dev` in new window When I stop page loading Sets a custom page load timeout for a part of the story When I set page load timeout to `$duration` $duration - total duration to wait for page load completion in ISO-8601 format Example 14. Before loading a heavy page set an increased timeout Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I set page load timeout to `PT20S` When I open URL `https://example.com/super-heavy-page` in new window When I set page load timeout to `PT10S` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 15. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view. When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - Locator Example 16. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located `id(way_down_button)` into view Checks web performance metrics. Then metric $webPerformanceMetric is $comparisonRule `$duration` $webPerformanceMetric - The web performance metric. Where: TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE - The time between the navigation start and the response start. DNS_LOOKUP_TIME - The time between the domain lookup start and the domain lookup end. DOM_CONTENT_LOAD_TIME - The time between the DOM loading and the the DOM complete. PAGE_LOAD_TIME - The time between the navgation start and the load event end. $comparisonRule - The duration comparison rule. $duration - The duration to compare against in ISO-8601 format. Example 17. Check page load Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com' Then metric PAGE_LOAD_TIME is less than `PT5S` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Type Argument Example DOUBLE_CLICK Search attribute or empty value By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Search attribute or empty value By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Search attribute or empty value By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text Minsk City CLICK Search attribute or empty value By.caseSensitiveText(Done) PRESS_KEYS Press Keys BACK_SPACE KEY_DOWN Press Keys SHIFT, ALT or CONTROL simultaneously CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Release Keys SHIFT, ALT or CONTROL simultaneously CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Search attribute By.id(username) Example 18. ActionSteps.story When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 19. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when locator’s visibility and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 20. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Waits for appearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 21. Wait for element appearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of an element by the locator. When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 22. Wait for element disappearance When I wait until element located `name(welcome-image)` disappears Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 23. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 24. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located `By.id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 25. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 26. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 27. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 28. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Verifies that an element located by locator exists for given duration.
