Synonyms: examples table, data table. ExamplesTable represents a tabular structure that holds rows of example data for parameters named via the column headers: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| Rows starting with an ignorable separator (defaults to |--) are allowed and ignored: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |-- A commented row --| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |-- Another commented row --| |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The separators are also configurable via inlined properties: {ignorableSeparator=!--,headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!} !header 1!header 2! .... !header n! !-- A commented row --! !value 11!value 12! .... !value 1n! ... !-- Another commented row --! !value m1!value m2! .... !value mn! Comments in column values are supported via the commentSeparator inlined property: {commentSeparator=#} | header 1#comment | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11#comment | value 12 | .... | value 1n | Comments including the separator are stripped. By default all column values are trimmed. To avoid trimming the values, use the trim inlined property: {trim=false} | header 1 | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11 | value 12 | .... | value 1n | By default, all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However, it might be required to map certain values to null-s. This can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| Line break is a default separator for rows in ExamplesTable, that’s why they can’t be added as is to the data. In order to put value with line breaks to ExamplesTable escape sequences (a character preceded by a backslash \\ is an escape sequence) must be used. Escape Sequence Description \\n Insert a newline in the value at this point. \\r Insert a carriage return in the text at this point. \\\\ Insert a backslash character in the text at this point. The inlined property processEscapeSequences defines whether escape sequences should be replaced in the data. It’s false by default (no property is declared explicitly). The allowed values are true and false, any other values are considered invalid and will lead to parsing error. {processEscapeSequences=true, commentSeparator=#} |header | |line 1\\nline 2 |# The value with a newline |line 1\\r\\nline 2|# The value with a carriage return and a newline |line 1\\\\nline 2 |# The value with an escaped escape sequence, the result will be \"line 1\\nline 2\" Synonyms: VIVIDUS expression. An expression is a special placeholder which is detected, evaluated and resolved during test execution. Expressions are used for the data generation and transformation. General expression syntax is: #{expression} During resolution process the expression placeholder is replaced with the result of the expression evaluation. If expression is unknown for VIVIDUS, the placeholder will be kept as is. If expression evaluation results in error, it will be propagated to the top level and the test will be marked as broken. Expression accepts 1 or more arguments as input parameters. It’s allowed to construct nested expressions: in this case the evaluation starts with the deepest expression. Expressions may include any number of variables placeholders. Expressions accepting exactly 1 argument process it as is: all leading and trailing spaces are preserved no symbols are changed or removed Expression Resulting argument #{expression(x)} x #{expression( x )} x #{expression( x, y, z )} x, y, z #{expression( x\\, y\\, z )} x\\, y\\, z #{expression(\"\"\" x, y, z \"\"\")} \"\"\" x, y, z \"\"\" The rules used for processing of expressions accepting more than 1 argument are following: comma , is a delimiter for arguments Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x,y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression(x:a,y;b,z)} argument 1: x:a argument 2: y;b argument 3: z #{expression(x,)} argument 1: x argument 2: all leading and trailing argument spaces are trimmed Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x, y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression( x , y , z )} argument 1: x argument 2: y argument 3: z #{expression( x , )} argument 1: x argument 2: meaningful commas (not used as delimiters) can be added to arguments in 2 ways: escape comma using backslash \\ Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x\\,a, y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x \\, a , y\\,b , )} argument 1: x , a argument 2: y,b argument 3: wrap argument into triple quotes (it might be convenient when arguments are get dynamically (e.g. from HTTP response) and escaping of such values could be a bit complicated) The leading and trailing spaces outside triple quotes are trimmed, but the leading and trailing spaces inside triple quotes are preserved. Expression Resulting arguments #{expression( \"\"\"x,a\"\"\" , y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x , \"\"\" y\\,b \"\"\")} Escaping of commas in triple quotes is not allowed, all data is used as argument value. argument 1: x argument 2: y\\,b #{expression( x , \"\"\"\"\"\")} argument 1: x argument 2: Synonyms: project resource, test resource. A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExamplesTable transformer. ExamplesTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\. Example 1. Escaping special characters in transformer properties {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER, countries=\\{Australia\\,Canada\\}} In the example above the transformer will have a single property with name countries and value {Australia,Canada}. VIVIDUS variables of scopes global and next batches can be used in transformer properties (pay attention to escapes of the variables placeholders in the example below). Example 2. Usage of global variable ${locale} in transformer property {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER, tables=/$\\{locale\\}/table1.table;/$\\{locale\\}/table2.table} Synonyms: hooks, fixtures. VIVIDUS provides a set of lifecycle steps to control the lifecycle of a story/steps of a test. They are executed in the following order and follow syntax: Before and After each story Example 3. Syntax for Before and After each story Lifecycle: Before: Scope: STORY [steps to be executed before each story] After: Scope: STORY [steps to be executed after each story] Before and After each scenario Example 4. Syntax for Before and After each scenario Lifecycle: Before: Scope: SCENARIO [steps to be executed before each scenario] After: Scope: SCENARIO [steps to be executed after each scenario] Before and After each step Example 5. Syntax for Before and After each step Lifecycle: Before: Scope: STEP [steps to be executed before each step] After: Scope: STEP [steps to be executed after each step] Additionally, scope can also be mixed and matched Example 6. Syntax combining scopes in a Lifecycle Lifecycle: Before: Scope: STORY [steps to be executed before each story] Scope: SCENARIO [steps to be executed before each scenario] Scope: STEP [steps to be executed before each step] After: Scope: STORY [steps to be executed after each story] Scope: SCENARIO [steps to be executed after each scenario] Scope: STEP [steps to be executed after each step]","title":"Glossary","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"glossary","url":"/vividus/latest/glossary.html","titles":[{"text":"ExamplesTable","hash":"_examplestable","id":1},{"text":"Preserving whitespace","hash":"_preserving_whitespace","id":2},{"text":"Mapping values to null-s","hash":"_mapping_values_to_null_s","id":3},{"text":"Using values with line breaks","hash":"_using_values_with_line_breaks","id":4},{"text":"Expression","hash":"_expression","id":5},{"text":"Single argument expressions","hash":"_single_argument_expressions","id":6},{"text":"Multi argument expressions","hash":"_multi_argument_expressions","id":7},{"text":"Resource","hash":"_resource","id":8},{"text":"Table Transformer","hash":"_table_transformer","id":9},{"text":"Lifecycle Steps","hash":"_lifecycle_steps","id":10}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"VIVIDUS is a test automation tool that offers already implemented solution for testing of most popular application types.

The property can be used to hide the Parameters section, making navigation easier. User has possibility to link stories/scenarios to external systems like test-management or bug-tracking systems. There are a few steps to achieve this: Configure link pattern via properties. Example 1. Configure link to issue tracking system in environment.properties system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{} Add meta tags to the story/scenario meta. Example 2. Story level meta-tag containing ID of the issue Meta: @issueId VVD-1 Scenario: Should check variables equals Then `1` is = `1` Run tests and explore the links in the report. Property name Meta tag Description Example system.allure.link.issue.pattern @issueId Issue link pattern https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/{} system.allure.link.requirement.pattern @requirementId Requirement link pattern https://github.com/vividus-framework/vividus/issues/{} system.allure.link.tms.pattern @testCaseId Test case link pattern https://vividus.jira.com/issues/{} It is possible to configure linking to multiple systems of the same type. To achieve this user should define a custom suffix for the properties and meta tags. Example 3. Configure links to several issue tracking systems in environment.properties # Default property system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.prod/issues/{} # Additional property with .dev suffix, that used to create links annotated with @isssueId.dev system.allure.link.issue.dev.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{} Example 4. Story level meta-tags containing IDs of the issues belonging to different systems Meta: @issueId VVD-1 @issueId.dev DEV-1 Scenario: Should check variables equal Then `1` is = `1` Put meta at story or/and scenario level. Meta tag name Allowed values Description Example @severity This meta tag is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please use @priority meta tag instead. Numeric values (range 1-5) Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important test, the highest number is the least important one. @severity 1 @priority Numeric values (range 1-5) Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important test, the highest number is the least important one. @priority 1 Run tests. Open the report and find the distribution of tests by priorities at Graphs tab. VIVIDUS can send notifications with test execution summary upon test completion.

VIVIDUS uses Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) which provides two-way encryption mechanism. While performing two-way encryption, apart from feeding plain-text it’s required to feed the secret text (i.e. password) and this secret text is used to decrypt the encrypted text. The default encryption algorithm is PBEWithMD5AndDES. Download the latest Jasypt release Unpack the downloaded zip-archive Go to bin folder Run the command performing encryption: Example 1.

Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued.

Could be overriden via corresponging batch setting. story.example-index-format \\u0020[0] The format defining how to display indices of story-level ExamplesTable rows when they are run in parallel. \\u0020 is a regular space represented as Unicode escape sequence, it is required to use this form, because the spaces before and after the equal sign are ignored in properties files. Special format chracters, e.g., 0, #, specify the way indices are displayed.

If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. engine.composite-paths Paths to the composite steps e.g. steps/*.steps A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question \"What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?\". These specifics (properties) should be written in the profile.properties file. Path to this file is set in configuration.properties file: Example 2. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=web It’s allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones. Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into profile.properties files in appropriate places. Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution. Let’s create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let’s see profiles structure for this case: └─ src/main/resources/properties └─ profile (1) ├─ web (2) ├─ chrome (4) └─ profile.properties (6) ├─ firefox (4) └─ profile.properties └─ profile.properties (5) ├─ mobile_app (2) ├─ iOS (7) └─ profile.properties ├─ android (7) └─ profile.properties (9) └─ profile.properties (8) └─ profile.properties (3) 1 Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties; 2 General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device; 3 The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device; 4 Web browsers' profiles (directories); 5 Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles; 6 Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices; 7 Mobile profiles (directories); 8 Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only; 9 Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup; By default, profile property is pointed to the /src/main/resources/properties/profile directory, so use the relative path starting from profile when you have nested directories: Example 3. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android Some of the plugins, like web-app, have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers. Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration. Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into environment.properties file. The path to this file is set in configuration.properties file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them: Example 4. configuration.properties configuration.environments=dev #configuration.environments=test #configuration.environments=prod Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the same approach of reusing and separating values. Configuration set simplifies reusage of pre-defined combinations of profiles/suites/environments. Users are allowed to define multiple configuration sets. Only one configuration set can be used during a test run. Example 5. Configuration sets definition configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.profiles= configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.suites=uat configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.environments=preprod configuration-set.api-test-regression.profiles= configuration-set.api-test-regression.suites=regression configuration-set.api-test-regression.environments=test Once configuration sets are defined, one can use an active configuration set for test execution. Example 6. Usage of configuration set configuration-set.active=api-preprod-uat Configuration sets can be defined only in configuration.properties file. Active configuration set overrides defined configuration.profiles, configuration.suites and configuration.environments properties. Configuration set requires to define profiles, suites and environments, empty value considered as a valid one. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 7. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 8. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @priority 1 @layout desktop Given I am on page with URL `https://www.epam.com/` Then page title is equal to `EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting` Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @priority 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/` Then page title is equal to `Google` The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 9. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 10. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 11. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 12. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @layout desktop, phone, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 13. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 14. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests. GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues. AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all. RED 3 Test report isn’t generated. Common errors: \"InvalidConfigurationException: No batches with tests to execute are configured\" - the configured suite has 0 batches, i.e. no tests to execute are configured. RED Here one could find description of general HTTP properties applied across all the HTTP interactions in VIVIDUS. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description General http.circular-redirects-allowed boolean false Allow circular redirects (redirects to the same location) http.connection-request-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the client connections pool. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.connect-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.max-total-connections integer 80 The number of maximum total connections for the client connections pool http.max-connections-per-route integer 60 The number of maximum connections per route for the client connections pool http.socket-timeout integer 300000 The timeout in milliseconds used for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.cookie-spec relaxed - The RFC 6265 compliant policy (interoperability profile). strict - The RFC 6265 compliant policy (strict profile). ignore - The policy that ignores cookies. relaxed The name of the cookie specification to be used for HTTP state management Authentication Integrated Windows authentication is enabled automatically whenever tests are run on Windows. http.auth.username character sequence The username, presence of this property requires the http.auth.password to be also set http.auth.password character sequence The password, presence of this property requires the http.auth.username to be also set http.auth.preemptive-auth-enabled boolean false If enabled the HTTP client will send the basic authentication data even before the service gives an unauthorized response (401), useful when the service doesn’t support unauthorized response (401) or to reduce the overhead of making the connection SSL handshake http.ssl.check-certificate boolean true Verify certificates sent by the server during SSL handshake, the most common errors occured during verfication are Expired SSL Certificate Error, SSL Certificate Not Trusted Error, SSL Certificate Revoked Error etc. http.ssl.verify-hostname boolean true Verify if the domain name in the SSL certificate matches the domain name in URL where the request is sent to Two-Way SSL authentication http.key-store.type Keystore type JKS The keystore type http.key-store.path Resource The keystore to load http.key-store.password string The password used to unlock the keystore and for the integrity checking http.ssl.private-key-password string The password for the private key DNS resolver http.local-dns-storage. key-value mapping The property prefix used to override the OS DNS lookup by specifying hostname to IP address mappings e.g. http.local-dns-storage.coursera.org=52.84.197.20 Service unavailability retry handler http.service-unavailable-retry.max-retries integer 1 The maximum number of allowed retries if the server responds with a HTTP code specified in http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes property http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes set of integers The set of HTTP status codes to be retried. If it’s empty, no retries will be performed http.service-unavailable-retry.retry-interval ISO-8601 Durations format PT1S The retry interval between subsequent requests Idempotent retry handler http.idempotent-methods-sending-request-body set of integers The list of HTTP methods containing request body which should be treated as idempotent for retries Most common use cases for externalized configuration are tests parametrization with properties passed from CI/CD pipeline, passing of secrets into test run etc. The available approaches are listed below. Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value variables.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.variables.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.variables.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. Generate the overriding.properties file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project. The following script assumes that we are in the root of the test project folder. cat > src/main/resources/overriding.properties ` in field located by `id(username)` When I enter `` in field located by `id(password)` When I click on element located by `id(signInButton)` Configure paths to files with custom steps: Example 16. Composite steps paths configuration engine.composite-paths=steps/ui/*.steps Use your step in the story: Example 17. Composite step usage example Scenario: Verify login Given I am on main application page When I login with username `admin` and password `pa$$w0rd` Users are allowed to use composite steps in composite step definition. VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let’s take the following step: Example 18. VIVIDUS step When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` Create a new JSON file (for example, aliases/aliases.json) and put the following content with one or more aliases: Example 19. aliases/aliases.json [ { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`\", \"aliases\": [ { \"name\": \"When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `$locator`\" }, { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse pointer over web element located `$locator`\" } ] } ] Point the alias configuration property to an exact location or location pattern with the JSON files containing aliases: engine.alias-paths=aliases/aliases.json Use the defined alias in place of actual step in your story When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `id(loginButton)`","title":"Tests Configuration","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"tests-configuration","url":"/vividus/latest/tests-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"configuration.properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":1},{"text":"Suites","hash":"_suites","id":2},{"text":"Profiles","hash":"_profiles","id":3},{"text":"Profiles setup","hash":"_profiles_setup","id":4},{"text":"Built-in profiles","hash":"_built_in_profiles","id":5},{"text":"Environments","hash":"_environments","id":6},{"text":"Configuration sets","hash":"_configuration_sets","id":7},{"text":"Known Issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":8},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":9},{"text":"Known Issues file","hash":"_known_issues_file","id":10},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":11},{"text":"Meta tags","hash":"_meta_tags","id":12},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":13},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_2","id":14},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":15},{"text":"1D tags (@key)","hash":"_1d_tags_key","id":16},{"text":"2D tags (@key  value)","hash":"_2d_tags_key_value","id":17},{"text":"Story Prioritization","hash":"_story_prioritization","id":18},{"text":"Exit codes","hash":"_exit_codes","id":19},{"text":"HTTP Configuration","hash":"_http_configuration","id":20},{"text":"Externalized Configuration","hash":"_externalized_configuration","id":21},{"text":"Composite steps","hash":"_composite_steps","id":22},{"text":"How to use composite steps","hash":"_how_to_use_composite_steps","id":23},{"text":"Steps aliases","hash":"_steps_aliases","id":24},{"text":"How to use steps aliases","hash":"_how_to_use_steps_aliases","id":25}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"In scope of this article the task term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities and that produces some output based on the work done.

For 20 years, I sought only this day. Nothing else existed…​ until I saw you. Then everything changed. I fell in love with you Evey. And to think I no longer believed I could. VForVendetta.speeches Our story begins, as these stories often do, with a young up-and-coming politician. He’s a deeply religious man and a member of the conservative party. He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of 'national security'. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently…​ but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience; for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary’s crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. And through it our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of High Chancellor. The rest, as they say, is history.

In this case - Internet. Click on its name to see the methods it contains. 3 One of the available methods within Internet data provider - password. There are multiple choices, we picked the fourth one. 4 Available arguments for the chosen method. There are three of them: int minimumLength - minimum number of symbols; int maximumLength - maximum number of symbols; boolean includeUppercase - true or false for Uppercase usage; In this way we created an expression that generates a password from 5 to 10 characters length including uppercase letters. Possible output is 51gVj5aLZY Replaces ? symbols with latin letters. #{generate(letterify '$input', '$isUpperCase')} $input - any string containing ? symbols to be replaced with letters $isUpperCase - boolean, set it to true for uppercase option Table 1. letterify examples Expression Result #{generate(letterify 'test????test')} testnjmytest #{generate(letterify 'test????test', 'true')} testXQBMtest Replaces # symbols with numbers. #{generate(numerify '$input')} $input - any string containing # symbols to be replaced with numbers Table 2. numerify example Expression Result #{generate(numerify 'test####test')} test5862test Combination of letterify and numerify. #{generate(bothify '$input')} $input - any string containing # and ? symbols to be replaced with numbers and letters accordingly Table 3. bothify example Expression Result #{generate(bothify 'test#?#?#?#test')} test2o7v0g9test Replaces symbol mentioned in the second argument with one of the symbols mentioned after it. #{generate(templatify '$input', '$whatToReplace', '$replacement1', '$replacement2', '$replacement3')} $input - any string to process $whatToReplace - part of the string to be replaced $replacement - replacement to use.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story. Variables are invalidated once the story is completed. next_batches Variables are available in the next batches. next_batches-scoped variable is not available in batch it’s declared within. batch Such variables are declared only with batch-.variables. prefix and available throughout the execution of the batch in the suite. An attempt to create the batch-scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 1. Declaring batch variable locale batch-1.variables.locale=/us/en/ batch-2.variables.locale=/uk/en/ Example 2. Using batch variable locale Given I am on main application page When I go to the relative URL '${locale}' global Such variables are declared only via properties with variables. prefix and available throughout the entire execution. An attempt to create the globally scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 3. Declaring global variable login-endpoint variables.login-endpoint=https://my-auth-server.com/api/login Example 4. Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `${login-endpoint}` Then response code is equal to `200` It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 5. Declaring global variable with expression random-user variables.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 6. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `/authenticate` Then response code is equal to `200` Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, batch-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 7. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario Given I initialize scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` Given I initialize story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario. Reference to uninitialized variable can be resolved to default value using the operator : (colon). Table 1. Examples of using default values Reference to resolve Variable value Output ${var:default} value value ${var:default} default ${var:} ${var:default:with:colons} default:with:colons ${var[0]:default} default ${var[0].key:default} default ${var:#{generate(DungeonsAndDragons.alignments)}} Chaotic Evil ${var:${var1}} var - , var1 - value value ${var:${var1:}} var - , var1 - Example 8.

Values from list variables can be accessed by index. For example, ${listVar[0]} returns the first value. Values from map variables can be accessed by key. For instance, ${mapVar.key} returns the value associated with 'key'. VIVIDUS provides the ability to store tables in variables. Tables should have a header and at least one row with values. Table 2. Assuming we have the table below stored in the variable 'tableVar': A B A1 B1 A2 B2 To access specific cell values, specify the row and header key. Rows indexing starts from 0. * ${tableVar[0].A} returns the value from the first row of column A: A1. * ${tableVar[1].B} returns the value from the second row of column B: B2.","title":"Variables","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"variables","url":"/vividus/latest/commons/variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution","id":1},{"text":"Regular variables","hash":"_regular_variables","id":2},{"text":"Scopes","hash":"_scopes","id":3},{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution_2","id":4},{"text":"Default values","hash":"_default_values","id":5},{"text":"Complex types variables","hash":"_complex_types_variables","id":6},{"text":"Accessing values","hash":"_accessing_values","id":7},{"text":"Working with tables","hash":"_working_with_tables","id":8}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Here one could find description of the steps that are delivered with Vividus itself without any plugins required.

Deprecated steps and their replacements can be found in the documentation using search, for example, this step. Steps can only be removed from VIVIDUS in a release with breaking changes. Usually MAJOR version is incremented on breaking changes releases according to the Semantic Versioning. But if project in initial development phase (has 0.y.z version) incremented only MINOR version. Also, breaking changes releases usually have the Removed section with changes in the release history. In case of update to version with breaking changes it is necessary to check presence of all removed steps in test project and replace them manually if this cannot be done automatically.","title":"Steps Deprecation","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"deprecating-steps","url":"/vividus/latest/developer-guides/deprecating-steps.html","titles":[{"text":"Deprecate Code Steps","hash":"_deprecate_code_steps","id":1},{"text":"Deprecate Composite Steps","hash":"_deprecate_composite_steps","id":2},{"text":"Find Deprecated Steps","hash":"_find_deprecated_steps","id":3},{"text":"In the log during/after tests execution","hash":"_in_the_log_duringafter_tests_execution","id":4},{"text":"In the report generated after tests execution","hash":"_in_the_report_generated_after_tests_execution","id":5},{"text":"Using print steps command","hash":"_using_print_steps_command","id":6},{"text":"In the documentation","hash":"_in_the_documentation","id":7},{"text":"Remove deprecated steps from tests","hash":"_remove_deprecated_steps_from_tests","id":8}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"VIVIDUS functionality can be extended with custom business logic.

More info zephyr.exporter.jira-instance-key false The key of the configured JIRA instance, in case of missing value it will be evaluated automatically based on issue keys being exported zephyr.exporter.source-directory true Path to directory with test execution JSON results. zephyr.project-key true Key of a Jira project where new test executions should be created zephyr.version-name true Version/release name where new test executions should be created zephyr.cycle-name true Cycle/sprint name where new test executions should be created zephyr.folder-name false Folder name where new test executions should be created The following properties are applicable only for Squad zephyr.exporter.statuses-of-test-cases-to-add-to-execution false List of test case statuses for adding to execution. zephyr.exporter.update-execution-statuses-only false Property for update existing executions statuses only. The Zephyr plugin for Jira has own configurable execution statuses. testExecutionStatus endpoint is used to get the detailed information about the statuses, like: https://jira.example.com/rest/zapi/latest/util/testExecutionStatus. The following properties are used to setup a mapping between Vividus and Zephyr execution statuses. This approach is similar for both API types (Scale and Squad), the major differences are Zephyr Scale has fewer test case statuses by default and the status representation during import (for Scale status transmitted in text format, like: Failed (Fail), but for Squad it transmitted in number format (status code), like: 7). Vividus execution status property name Zephyr Squad execution status value (by default) Zephyr Scale execution status value zephyr.statuses.FAILED FAILED Fail zephyr.statuses.BROKEN TEST NEEDS REWORK Fail zephyr.statuses.PENDING TEST NEEDS REWORK In Progress zephyr.statuses.UNKNOWN PASSED WITH REMARKS Pass zephyr.statuses.SKIPPED SCHEDULED Not Executed zephyr.statuses.PASSED PASSED Pass If the authentication through basic schema is available on your JIRA instance use jira..http.auth.username and jira..http.auth.password properties, both properties must be set. It’s also advisible to turn the preemptive authentication on. jira..http.auth.username=admin jira..http.auth.password=5401a7d27b291c5d jira..http.auth.preemptive-auth-enabled=true In case of two-factor authentication, token authentication or any other complex authentication process it’s possible to use request headers like the following example shows: Example 2. Authenticate using Bearer token jira..http.headers.Authorization=Bearer D5YY0qJDxFDOZjCEpINMTdcQQxNtATrMw/IAsyWI+CzE Example 3. Authenticate using session cookies jira..http.headers.Cookie=SESSIONID=298zf09hf012fh2 Both jira..http.auth.username and jira..http.auth.password properties must be empty in this case.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for Java, which defines how a client may access a database. Every JDBC requires using specific driver. JDBC drivers are client-side adapters (installed on the client machine, not on the server) that convert requests from Java programs to a protocol that the database management system (DBMS) can understand. Copy the below line code to dependencies section of the project build.gradle file Example 1. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.6.13-SNAPSHOT') Define your JDBC driver and add appropriate dependency. Let’s take PostgreSQL as an example: Open JDBC page on maven repository; Find driver for your database and open details (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver); Choose and open version (42.5.4); Go to the Gradle tab and copy implementation string; Paste chosen dependency into your build.gradle file: Example 2. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.7.3') In case Maven repository does not contain driver you need, please refer to the documentation of your database to define suitable JDBC driver. If the project was imported to the IDE before adding new plugin, re-generate the configuration files for the used IDE and then refresh the project in the used IDE. For database interaction, you will need to set related properties. They have db.connection. prefix followed by the database connection name (vividus in the example). Come up with your own database name to use within the tests. Put properties into the environment.properties file: Example 3. environment.properties db.connection.vividus.url=jdbc:dbms://databaseUrl:port/databaseName?parameter1=true¶meter2=value (1) db.connection.vividus.username= (2) db.connection.vividus.password= (2) db.connection.vividus.driver-class-name=(3) 1 Database address. Consists of: jdbc: - reference to JDBC; dbms: - Database Management System, e.g. postgresql; //databaseUrl - address to your database; :port - port number, e.g. 5432; /databaseName - name of your database; parameters - any additional driver parameters you need to pass; URL structure slightly changes depending on the database management system. You can find templates for different DBMS in setup examples. 2 Credentials for given database connection; 3 Driver class name (Optional), e.g. org.postgresql.Driver. You might need it to specify the driver name for the exact database. Here are some examples of setting different databases connection for most popular DBMS-s.

When you are writing tests for the electron based application you have few options to use DevTools. The first one relies on the embedded DevTools. The second option is to use remote DevTools debugging. The simplest way is to start your application with --remote-debugging-port= flag. Once the port is passed as an argument, DevTools will be available at http://localhost:; Figure 1. Available Application Windows Example 4.

JSON path expressions always refer to a JSON structure in the same way as XPath expression are used in combination with an XML document. The \"root member object\" in JSON path is always referred to as $ regardless if it is an object or array. JSON path expressions can use the dot–notation $.store.book[0].title or the bracket–notation $['store']['book'][0]['title'] The official JSON path guide conatins examples of JSON paths. Also the number of operators and functions are available for use in JSON paths out of the box. At the same time additional functions provided by this plugin are listed below. Use JSON path online validator to test your JSON path. distinct() - removes duplicated items from the input array. Table 1.

When I find $comparisonRule `$elementsNumber` JSON elements in `$json` by `$jsonPath` and until variable `$variableName` $variableMatcher `$expectedValue` for each element I do:$stepsToExecute Example 14. Alias When I find $comparisonRule '$elementsNumber' JSON elements in '$json' by '$jsonPath' and until variable '$variableName' $variableMatcher '$expectedValue' for each element I do:$stepsToExecute comparisonRule - The comparison rule. elementsNumber - The expected number of elements. json - The JSON used to find JSON elements. jsonPath - The JSON path used to find JSON elements. variableName - The name of the variable to validate. variableMatcher - The string comparison rule. expectedValue - The expected value of the variable. stepsToExecute - The ExamplesTable with a single column containing the steps to execute for each found JSON element. Example 15. Find the title from JSON When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vividus-framework/JsonPath/master/json-path-web-test/src/main/resources/webapp/json/goessner.json` When I find > `1` JSON elements in `${response}` by `$.store.book` and until variable `title` matches `M.+` for each element I do: |step| |When I save JSON element value from `${json-context}` by JSON path `$.title` to scenario variable `title`| Then `Moby Dick` is = `${title}` Validates if the given JSON contains the expected JSON element value matching the comparison rule by the specified JSON path. Then JSON element value from `$json` by JSON path `$jsonPath` $comparisonRule `$expectedValue` $json - The JSON used to find JSON element value. $jsonPath - The JSON path used to find JSON element value. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule to match JSON element value depending on the element type: for string - string comparison rules are applicable, for number - regular comparison rules are applicable, for boolean - only single rule IS_EQUAL_TO (readable form: is equal to) is allowed, for null - only two rules IS_EQUAL_TO and IS_NOT_EQUAL_TO (readable forms: is equal to and is not equal to) are allowed array and object are complex types and must be validated using another steps dedicated for JSON elements. $expectedValue - The expected value of JSON element to match according to the comparison rule. Example 16. Validate the price of the fourth book is greater than 22.50 When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vividus-framework/JsonPath/master/json-path-web-test/src/main/resources/webapp/json/goessner.json` Then JSON element value from `${response}` by JSON path `$.store.book[3].price` is greater than `22.50` Validates if the given JSON contains the expected JSON element matching the comparison rule by the specified JSON path. Then JSON element from `$json` by JSON path `$jsonPath` is equal to `$expectedData`$options json - The JSON used to find the actual JSON element. jsonPath - The JSON path used to find the actual JSON element. expectedData - The expected JSON element to compare against. options - The set of JSON comparison options. Example 17. Validate JSON contains string value by JSON path Then JSON element from ` { \"accountId\": 12345, \"status\": \"Active\" } ` by JSON path `$.status` is equal to `\"Active\"` Validates the number of JSON elements found by the JSON path matches the expected number according to the specified comparison rule. Then number of JSON elements from `$json` by JSON path `$jsonPath` is $comparisonRule $elementsNumber json - The JSON used to find the actual JSON elements. jsonPath - The JSON path used to find JSON elements. comparisonRule - The comparison rule. elementsNumber - The expected number of JSON elements. Example 18. Validate the number of accounts in JSON is equal to 2 Then number of JSON elements from ` [ { \"accountId\": 843 }, { \"accountId\": 233 } ] ` by JSON path `$..accountId` is equal to 2 Validates JSON against JSON Schema. Then JSON `$json` is valid against schema `$schema` $json - The JSON to validate. $schema - The JSON Schema. The step validates JSON according to schema specification version provided in the schema itself, e.g.: \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\" If the version is not present in the schema then JSON is validated according to 2020-12 version. Example 19. Validate product for sale information Then JSON ` { \"productId\": 1, \"productName\": \"A desk lamp\", \"price\": 12.50, \"tags\": [ \"lamp\", \"desk\" ] } ` is valid against schema ` { \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\", \"$id\": \"https://example.com/product.schema.json\", \"title\": \"Product\", \"description\": \"A product from catalog\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"productId\": { \"description\": \"The unique identifier for a product\", \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"productName\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"price\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"exclusiveMinimum\": 0 }, \"tags\": { \"description\": \"Tags for the product\", \"type\": \"array\", \"prefixItems\": [{ \"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"lamp\", \"desk\"] }], \"minItems\": 1, \"uniqueItems\": true } }, \"required\": [ \"productId\", \"productName\", \"price\", \"tags\" ] } ` Matcher is an object which compares objects against a specific criteria and returns a boolean value indicating whether the match was successful or not. Embedded matchers, placeholders and expressions can be found on the json-unit library readme. Validate if actual array contains any of entries from the expected one. #{json-unit.matches:anyOf}($input) $input - any string which represents expected array entries Example 20. Validate entries Given I initialize story variable `actual-json` with value ` { \"store\":{ \"authors\":[ { \"name\":\"Yakub Kolas\", \"available\":true }, { \"name\":\"Uladzimir Karatkevich\", \"available\":true } ] } } ` Then JSON element from `${actual-json}` by JSON path `$.store` is equal to `{\"book\":\"#{json-unit.matches:anyOf}[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Uladzimir Karatkevich\\\",\\\"available\\\":true},{\\\"author\\\":\\\"Yanka Kupala\\\",\\\"available\\\":true}])}\"` As JSON do not support multi line strings if you want to improve readability use escapeJson expression inside matcher Example 21. Validate entries with escapeJson expression Then JSON element from `${actual-json}` by JSON path `$.store` is equal to ` { \"book\":\"#{json-unit.matches:anyOf}#{escapeJson([ { \"name\":\"Uladzimir Karatkevich\", \"available\":true }, { \"author\":\"Yanka Kupala\", \"available\":true } ])}\" }","title":"JSON Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-json","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-json.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"JSON Path","hash":"_json_path","id":2},{"text":"JSON Path Functions","hash":"_json_path_functions","id":3},{"text":"distinct()","hash":"_distinct","id":4},{"text":"Dynamic variables","hash":"_dynamic_variables","id":5},{"text":"JSON context","hash":"_json_context","id":6},{"text":"Table Transformers","hash":"_table_transformers","id":7},{"text":"FROM_JSON","hash":"_from_json","id":8},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":9},{"text":"Save JSON element value","hash":"_save_json_element_value","id":10},{"text":"Save JSON element","hash":"_save_json_element","id":11},{"text":"Save number of JSON elements","hash":"_save_number_of_json_elements","id":12},{"text":"Convert JSON to variable","hash":"_convert_json_to_variable","id":13},{"text":"Patch JSON","hash":"_patch_json","id":14},{"text":"Execute steps on JSON elements","hash":"_execute_steps_on_json_elements","id":15},{"text":"Execute steps on JSON elements and exit on condition","hash":"_execute_steps_on_json_elements_and_exit_on_condition","id":16},{"text":"Validate JSON element value","hash":"_validate_json_element_value","id":17},{"text":"Validate JSON element","hash":"_validate_json_element","id":18},{"text":"Validate number of JSON elements","hash":"_validate_number_of_json_elements","id":19},{"text":"Validate JSON against schema","hash":"_validate_json_against_schema","id":20},{"text":"Matchers","hash":"_matchers","id":21},{"text":"Array contains any of entries","hash":"_array_contains_any_of_entries","id":22}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"The plugin provides integration with an open-source distributed event streaming platform Apache Kafka.

The property value may vary depending on test cloud providers and can be found in the XCode logs. ${clipboard-text} Example 8. Verify clipboard content Then `${clipboard-text}` is equal to `uarlouski@gmail.com` Context element rectangle dynamic variables are deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0, please use Save size and coordinates of element step. The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 9. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the current UI context of the application under test. ${context-source-code} Example 10. Firstly check frames on the entire page, and then links in the specified context Given I am on main application page Then all resources by selector `frame,iframe` from ${context-source-code} are valid When I change context to element located by `id(linksList)` Then all resources by selector `a` from ${context-source-code} are valid Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. The variable is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please use ${context-source-code} dynamic variable instead. ${source-code} Example 11. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Given I start mobile application Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides globally-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilities have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 12. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 13. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 14. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen (the remote session will not be closed). If the application is not running, new failed assertion is recorded. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS of the application to terminate. Example 15. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Runs mobile application in the background for specific period of time and either activates the app after a certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated (when PT-1S is used). See Appium docs for more details. When I send mobile application to background for `$period` period $period - The period of time in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 16. Run app in background When I send mobile application to background for `PT5S` period Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(login-button)` is equal to `1` Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The iOS or Android settings to set. Example 17. Configure to show invisible elements When I change Appium session settings: |name |value| |allowInvisibleElements|true | Uploads a file to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 18. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image Upload the file with data to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file with name `$fileName` and data `$data` to device $data - The data to store as a file. $fileName - The name of the uploaded file. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 19.

Upload the file with the text data to the device When I upload file with name `message.txt` and data `This is a message` to device Then message file is displayed in file explorer Deletes a file from the device/emulator/simulator. When I delete file `$filePath` from device Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be downloaded/deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to download/delete a file from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type for real devices is documents. Containers available for Simulators: app, data, groups, . If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a specially formatted path, which points to an item inside an app bundle, for example @my.app.id/my/path. It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format. /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle Example 21. Delete file When I delete file `/sdcard/Pictures/avatar.png` from device On iOS real device to add or delete photo or video to/from \"Camera Roll\" you need upload/delete photos or videos to/from /DCIM/100APPLE/ folder and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. Restart device is necessary after that. On iOS simulator to delete photo or video from \"Camera Roll\" you need to delete photo or video from /Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. And then restart simulator.

It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format. /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the file content. Example 22. Download file When I download file `/sdcard/file.json` from device and save its content to scenario variable `json-file` The term \"context\" or \"search context\" refers to the area within which the element lookup is performed. By changing the context during the process of locating elements, it is possible to significantly streamline the creation and maintenance of tests. This helps to build more efficient and effective test cases, reducing the time spent interacting with unnecessary elements or searching the entire screen for the desired element. Resets the context, finds the element by the given locator and sets the context to this element if it’s found. When I change context to element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to change context to. Example 23. Change context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` Finds the element by the given locator in the current context and sets the context to this element if it’s found. When I change context to element located by `$locator` in scope of current context Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - The locator used to find the element to change context to. Example 24. Change context in scope of the current context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` When I change context to element located `id(first-row)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `id(table)` is equal to `0` Resets the context if it was set previously. When I reset context Example 25. Reset context behaviour Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` Waits for a tab with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until tab with title that $comparisonRule `$title` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a tab in ISO-8601 Durations format. $comparisonRule - The tab title comparison rule. $title - The expected tab title. Example 26. Wait for tab and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/windows.html` When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until tab with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Validates the context contains the number of elements matching the specified comparison rule. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - The locator used to find elements. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 27. Validate the number of elements Then number of elements found by `xpath(./a)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':v' and 'VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Validate elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':v' and checked state - 'NOT_VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 28. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `id(img)` is = `1` Finds the element by the given locator and saves its text into a variable. When I save text of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find the element whose text content will be saved. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text content. Example 29. Save the text of the header element When I save text of element located by `id(header)` to scenario variable `heading-text` Saves the text of the context element into a variable. An error is thrown if the context is not set to the element. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text content. Example 30. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save text of context element to scneario variable `username` Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Switches context to a web view with name that matches the rule (see Automating hybrid apps for more information). Also, Appium capabilities for iOS and Android are available for the fine-tuning configuration. When I switch to web view with name that $comparisonRule `$value` $comparisonRule - The web view name comparison rule. $value - The value to find the target web view. Example 31. Switch to web view by name Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I switch to web view with name that contains `vividustestapp` Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Switches context to a mobile native context. See Automating hybrid apps for more information. When I switch to native context Example 32. Switch to native context Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I switch to native context Then number of elements found by `xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Taps on the element located by the locator. The atomic actions performed are: press on the element; release. When I tap on element located by `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 33. Tap on element When I tap on element located by `accessibilityId(menu-toggler)` Taps on the element located by the locator with the specified duration. The atomic actions performed are: press on the element; wait for the duration; release. When I tap on element located by `$locator` with duration `$duration` $locator - Locator. $duration - The duration between an element is pressed and released in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 34. Tap on element with duration When I tap on element located by `accessibilityId(menu-toggler)` with duration `PT0.5S` Performs double tap on the element located by the locator. The step is supported for Android and iOS platforms. When I double tap on element located by `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 35. Double tap on element When I double tap on element located by `accessibilityId(increment)` Presses iOS keys or Android keys. When I press $key key $key - The key to press. Example 36. Go to Home screen When I press Home key Performs long press of iOS keys or Android keys. to modify long press duration for iOS and tvOS you could use mobile-application.long-press-duration property.

To send special key like HOME please use Press keys. When I type text `$text` $text - The text to type. Example 39. Enter password When I type text `pas1$` Types the text into the element located by the locator. The existing text is re-written by the text passed into the step. The atomic actions performed are: type text into the element; hide keyboard. For iOS real devices the hide keyboard action works only for XCUIElementTypeTextField elements and skipped for XCUIElementTypeTextView elements, in case of XCUIElementTypeTextView element tap outside the text view is performed to close the keyboard. When I type `$text` in field located `$locator` $text - The text to type into the element. $locator - Locator. Example 40. Type text When I type `Bob` in field located `accessibilityId(username)` Only types text into the element. The keyboard hiding is skipped. When I type `$text` in field located `$locator` and keep keyboard opened $text - The text to type into the element. $locator - Locator. Example 41. Type text and keep keyboard opened When I type `Bob` in field located `accessibilityId(username)` and keep keyboard opened Clears the field located by the locator. The atomic actions performed are: clear the field; hide keyboard. For iOS real devices the hide keyboard action works only for XCUIElementTypeTextField elements and skipped for XCUIElementTypeTextView elements, in case of XCUIElementTypeTextView element tap outside the text view is performed to close the keyboard. When I clear field located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 42. Clear the field When I clear field located `accessibilityId(username)` Only clears the field located by the locator. The keyboard hiding is skipped. When I clear field located `$locator` and keep keyboard open $locator - Locator. Example 43. Clear text and keep keyboard open When I clear field located `accessibilityId(username)` and keep keyboard open Swipes to an element in either UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT direction with the specified swipe duration. The step takes into account the current context. If you need to perform swipe on the element, you need to switch the context to this element. mobile-application.swipe.limit - defines max numbers of swipes to perform (if it’s reached the swipe process is stopped and the error is thrown) mobile-application.swipe.stabilization-duration - defines a duration to wait after swipe until view becomes stable mobile-application.swipe.vertical.x-position - defines a vertical swipe x axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to x=1 and 100 corresponds to x = mobile screen width - 1, default value is 0 mobile-application.swipe.horizontal.y-position - defines a horizontal swipe y axis position in percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to y=1 and 100 corresponds to y = mobile screen height - 1, default value is 50 When I swipe $direction to element located by `$locator` with duration $swipeDuration $direction - The direction to swipe: UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. $locator - Locator. $swipeDuration - The swipe duration in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 44. Swipe to an element Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `0` When I swipe UP to element located by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(end-of-screen)` is equal to `1` Example 45. Swipe the context element Scenario: Switch slides When I change context to element located by `accessibilityId(carousel)` Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `0` When I swipe LEFT to element located by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` with duration PT1S Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(slide 2)` is equal to `1` Executes the sequence of touch actions. When I execute sequence of touch actions: $actions $actions - The table with actions to execute. Table 1. Possible actions type argument Argument example TAP Element locator or empty By.id(Name) TAP_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty By.id(Name) MOVE_TO Element locator By.id(username) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point, that specifies x and y distance to move from its current position or from upper left corner (0,0), if the pointer has not previously been moved (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE empty WAIT Duration PT1S - wait 1 second RELEASE action releases the finger at the current touch location. For example, it can be used in the following sequence of actions:`TAP_AND_HOLD` → MOVE_BY_OFFSET → RELEASE Example 46. Execute touch actions When I execute sequence of touch actions: |type |argument | |TAP_AND_HOLD |By.id(Hello World)| |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(0,200) | |RELEASE | | Performs zoom in/out Zoom in Zoom out The step takes into account the current context. If you need to perform zoom on the element, you need to switch the context to this element. Property Name Acceptable values Default value Description mobile-application.zoom.indent.top size in percentage 30 The size of the top part of the context to be excluded from zoom area mobile-application.zoom.indent.bottom size in percentage 30 The size of the bottom part of the context to be excluded from zoom area mobile-application.zoom.indent.right size in percentage 20 The size of the right part of the context to be excluded from zoom area mobile-application.zoom.indent.left size in percentage 20 The size of the left part of the context to be excluded from zoom area The indent percentage value should be from 0 to 99.

Example 49. Select next item in the picker wheel When I select next value with `0.1` offset in picker wheel located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypePickerWheel)->filter.index(3)` Records performance metrics of iOS application. It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 50. Perform profiling during application usage When I start recording `Time Profiler` metrics !-- set of actions to measure performance When I stop recording `Time Profiler` metrics and save results to file `${outputDirectory}/time_profiler.zip` Sets the slider value in percents. The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypeSlider. The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively. When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypeSlider element. $percent - The target value of the slider in percents. Example 51. Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `90` percents Example 52. Set value of iOS slider (with range -50:50) to 20 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `70` percents Example 53. Set value of iOS slider (with range 18:65) to 55 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range. The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations. The target element must be of type android.widget.SeekBar. The number must be greater than or equal to 0. Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure. When I set value of Android slider located `$locator` to `$number` $locator - The locator to find android.widget.SeekBar element. $number - The number to set on the slider Example 54. Set value of Android slider (with range 0:50) to 13 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `13` Example 55.

When I take screenshot Takes a screenshot and saves it to the file at the specified path. The full path to the file with the taken screenshot is posted to logs and report. When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `$screenshotFilePath` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I take screenshot and save it to folder `$screenshotFilePath` $screenshotFilePath - The path to the file to save the screenshot, the allowed values are: an absolute path to the file, e.g. C:\\Windows\\screenshot.png; a relative path (it is resolved from the current working directory, e.g. screenshot.png. Example 57. Take a screenshot and save it to the file When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `${screenshot-directory}/start-page.png` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 58. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `id(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 59. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `id(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for an element with the specified state to be found using the specified timeout with polling interval. When I wait `$duration` with `$pollingDuration` polling until element located by `$locator` becomes $state $duration - Total duration to wait in the ISO-8601 format. $pollingDuration - The duration to wait between search retries in the ISO-8601 format. $locator - The locator of the element to wait for state change. $state - The element state. Example 60. Verify that the element become invisible up to 10 times When I wait `PT10S` with `PT1S` polling until element located by `id(element-to-hide)` becomes not visible Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 61. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 62. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Waits for element with the specified locator to stop moving. An element is considered moving when its coordinates (position) are changing. For example, an animated GIF is not a moving element unless it changes position. When I wait until element located by `$locator` stops moving $locator - Locator. Example 63. Wait for element with the specified id to stop moving When I wait until element located by `id(submitForm)` stops moving Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 64. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value.

Example 65. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located by `xpath(//a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Saves the information about the size of an element and its coordinates relative to the viewport. When I save coordinates and size of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the coordinates and size of an element which can be accessed on the variable name using dot notation (please see examples section): Attribute Description x the x coordinate y the y coordinate height the height of the element width the width of the element Example 66. Verify image size and coordinates When I save coordinates and size of element located by `tagName(img)` to scenario variable `rect` Then `${rect.height}` is equal `400` Then `${rect.width}` is equal `400` Then `${rect.x}` is equal `200` Then `${rect.y}` is equal `8` Validates the element located by the locator has existed for the period specified by the duration. The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration. Then element located by `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - The Locator to find an element. $duration - The period of time the element should have existed in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 67. The element should have existed for 5 second Then element located by `id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Waits until an element with the specified locator has text that matches the provided regular expression. When I wait until element located by `$locator` has text matching `$regex` $locator - The Locator of the element which text to check. $regex - The regular expression used to validate the text of the element. Example 68. The element should have text consisting of numbers only When I wait until element located by `id(indicator)` has text matching `\\d+` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order. The collection should have at least one element with not empty text, otherwise the step fails. Then elements located by `$locator` are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order $locator - Locator. $sortingOrder Plain Readable Description ASCENDING ascending Verify that elements are sorted in ascending order DESCENDING descending Verify that elements are sorted in descending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_ASCENDING case-insensitive ascending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive ascending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_DESCENDING case-insensitive descending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive descending order Example 69.

Example 4. Validate 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title is equal to `What is VIVIDUS :: VIVIDUS` Example 5. Validate the part of 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title contains `VIVIDUS` The term \"context\" or \"search context\" refers to the area within which the element lookup is performed. By changing the context during the process of locating elements, it is possible to significantly streamline the creation and maintenance of tests. This helps to build more efficient and effective test cases, reducing the time spent interacting with unnecessary elements or searching the entire screen for the desired element. Resets the context, finds the element by the given locator and sets the context to this element if it’s found. When I change context to element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to change context to. Example 6. Change context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` Finds the element by the given locator in the current context and sets the context to this element if it’s found. When I change context to element located by `$locator` in scope of current context Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - The locator used to find the element to change context to. Example 7. Change context in scope of the current context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` When I change context to element located `id(first-row)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `id(table)` is equal to `0` Resets the context if it was set previously. When I reset context Example 8. Reset context behaviour Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` Waits for a tab with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until tab with title that $comparisonRule `$title` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a tab in ISO-8601 Durations format. $comparisonRule - The tab title comparison rule. $title - The expected tab title. Example 9. Wait for tab and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/windows.html` When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until tab with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Opens a new browser tab and switches the focus for future commands to this tab. When I open new tab Example 10. Open page in a new tab When I open new tab Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` Closes the current tab and switches to the last browser tab. When I close current tab This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open. Example 11. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com` When I open new tab Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/contact-us` When I close current tab Finds the element by the given locator and performs a click in the center of the element if it’s found (at first moves mouse to the location of the element). When I click on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to click. Example 12. Click on element with name Submit When I click on element located by `name(Submit)` Finds the element by the given locator and performs a right-click in the center of the element if it’s found (at first moves mouse to the location of the element). When I perform right-click on element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I perform right click on element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to right-click. Example 13. Right-click on the element with id attribute having value clickme When I perform right-click on element located by `id(clickme)` Finds the element by the given locator and moves a mouse cursor over the center of the element, if it’s found. When I hover mouse over element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to hover mouse over. Example 14. Hover mouse over element with id attribute having value tooltip When I hover mouse over element located by `id(tooltip)` Fields are elements where users can enter data. The most typical fields are: elements, elements, [contenteditable] elements (e.g CKE editors, they are usually located via tag, that is placed in a frame as a separate HTML document). Enter the text in the field found by the given locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the field by the locator; clear the field if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; type the text in the field. When I enter `$text` in field located by `$locator` $text - The text to enter in the field. $locator - The locator used to find the field to enter the text. Example 15. Type text pa$$w0rd in the field with attribute id having value password When I enter `pa$$w0rd` in field located by `id(password)` Enters the text in the field, found by the given locator, without clearing the previous content. When I add `$text` to field located by `$locator` $text - The text to add to the field. $locator - The locator used to find the field to add the text. Example 16. Add text name to the field with attribute id having value username When I add `name` to field located by `id(username)` Finds the field by the given locator and clears it if it’s found. When I clear field located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the field to clear. Example 17. Clear the field with attribute id having value email When I clear field located by `id(email)` Validates the context contains the number of elements matching the specified comparison rule. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - The locator used to find elements. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 18. Validate the number of elements Then number of elements found by `xpath(./a)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':v' and 'VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Validate elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':v' and checked state - 'NOT_VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 19. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `id(img)` is = `1` Finds the element by the given locator and saves its text into a variable. When I save text of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find the element whose text content will be saved. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text content. Example 20. Save the text of the header element When I save text of element located by `id(header)` to scenario variable `heading-text` Saves the text of the context into a variable. When I save text of context to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text content. Example 21. Save the text of the context When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save text of context element to scneario variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 22. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located by `id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 23. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located by `xpath(//a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Saves the information about the size of an element and its coordinates relative to the viewport. When I save coordinates and size of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the coordinates and size of an element which can be accessed on the variable name using dot notation (please see examples section): Attribute Description x the x coordinate y the y coordinate height the height of the element width the width of the element Example 24. Verify image size and coordinates When I save coordinates and size of element located by `tagName(img)` to scenario variable `rect` Then `${rect.height}` is equal `400` Then `${rect.width}` is equal `400` Then `${rect.x}` is equal `200` Then `${rect.y}` is equal `8` The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched across the whole page. Validates the text is present in the current context. The expected text is case-sensitive. Then text `$text` exists $text - The expected text to be found in the context text. Example 25. Check the text 'Contract Us' is present on the page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then text `Contact Us` exists Validates the text is not present in the current context. Then text `$text` does not exist $text - The text that should not be present in the context. Example 26. Check the text 'Deprecated' is not present in the element When I change context to element located by `id(code)` Then text `Deprecated` does not exist Validates the text from current context matches the specified regular expression. Then text matches `$regex` $regex - The regular expression used to validate the context text. Example 27. Check the text with pattern 'User \".*\" successfully logged in' is present in the current context When I change context to element located by `id(message)` Then text matches `User \".*\" successfully logged in` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 28. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `id(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 29. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `id(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for an element with the specified state to be found using the specified timeout with polling interval. When I wait `$duration` with `$pollingDuration` polling until element located by `$locator` becomes $state $duration - Total duration to wait in the ISO-8601 format. $pollingDuration - The duration to wait between search retries in the ISO-8601 format. $locator - The locator of the element to wait for state change. $state - The element state. Example 30. Verify that the element become invisible up to 10 times When I wait `PT10S` with `PT1S` polling until element located by `id(element-to-hide)` becomes not visible Waits for an element, located by the specified locator in the given search context, to change to the specified state. When I wait until state of element located by `$locator` is $state $locator - The locator used to find element. $state - The expected element state. Example 31. Click on the button and wait until the element becomes invisible When I click on element located by `id(signInButton)` When I wait until state of element located by `id(signInButton):a` is NOT VISIBLE Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 32. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `xpath(//a)` is equal to `5` Waits until the current page title matches the certain title using specified comparison rule. When I wait until page title $comparisonRule `$pattern` $comparisonRule - String comparison rule. $pattern - The expected title pattern of the current page. Example 33. Check that current title ends with \"Domain\" Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` When I wait until page title matches `.*Domain` Executes passed JavaScript code on the opened page. When I execute javascript `$jsCode` $jsCode - The JavaScript code. Example 34. Click on the link using JavaScript Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com` When I execute javascript `document.querySelector('a').click()` Executes passed JavaScript code on the opened page and saves result into variable.

When I switch to frame located by `$locator` $locator - Locator of frame element. Example 37. Switch to frame Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/nestedFrames.html` Then text `Modal Frame Example` does not exist When I switch to frame located by `id(parent)` Then text `Modal Frame Example` exists Selects the first option in dropdown whose value attribute is equal to the provided value (case-insensitive). When I select `$option` in dropdown located by `$locator` $option - The option to select. $locator - The locator used to find dropdown. Example 38. Select option with the value Red in dropdown When I select `Red` in dropdown located by `id(colors)` Checks the context element has the expected CSS property. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. Then context element has CSS property `$cssName` with value that $comparisonRule `$cssValue` $cssName - A name of the CSS property. $comparisonRule - CSS property comparison rule. $cssValue - The expected value of the CSS property. Example 39. Change context to element and verify it color CSS property value When I change context to element located by `id(rainbow)` Then context element has CSS property `color` with value that is equal to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)` Executes the steps while the found elements exist. To avoid infinite loops the iterationLimit parameter is used. If iteration’s limit reached the step will fail. When I find $comparisonRule `$number` elements `$locator` and while they exist do up to $iterationLimit iteration of$stepsToExecute Alias: When I find $comparisonRule '$number' elements $locator and while they exist do up to $iterationLimit iteration of$stepsToExecute $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The number of elements to find. $locator - Locator. $iterationLimit - The maximum number of iterations to perform. $stepsToExecute - The ExamplesTable with a single column containing the steps to execute.

Remove item with 'token' key from web storage When I remove item with key `token` from session storage Removes all items from web storage. When I clear $storageType storage $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. Example 53. Clear session storage When I clear session storage Uploads the resource or file via web interface. When I select element located by `$locator` and upload `$resourceNameOrFilePath` $locator - the locator of the web element with input tag and attribute type=file $resourceNameOrFilePath - relative path to the file to be uploaded Example 54. Upload file_for_upload.png file When I select element located by `id(uploadfile)` and upload file `/folder/file_for_upload.png` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 55. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located by `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view with centred positioning. If the element to scroll is located inside an overflow container then native scrollIntoView JS method with top alignment is used. When I scroll element located by `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 56. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located by `id(way_down_button)` into view Checks if the page is scrolled to the specific element Then page is scrolled to element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 57. Validate Contact link is scrolled into view Then page is scrolled to element located by `xpath(//a[text()=\"Contact\"])` Save the HTTP message part from the HTTP request with given URL-pattern into the variable with specified name and the scopes. This step requires network recording to be turned on. It can be done in properties via \"proxy.recording.enabled\" or by switching on \"@proxy\" meta tag at the story or scenario level. The actions performed by the step: extract HTTP messages from the network recording archive find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression check that total number of the found HTTP messages is equal to 1 save the HTTP message part to the specified variable When I capture HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` and save $httpMessagePart to $scopes variable `$variableName` $httpMethods - The comma-separated set of HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. GET, POST, PUT. $urlPattern - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL. $httpMessagePart - The HTTP message part to save. One of: URL - The request URL. URL query - The request URL query parameters. request data - The request data includes the following keys: query - The URL query is stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the query parameter and value is the list of query parameter values. The query parameter values are accessible via zero-based index. resourceType - The request’s resource type as it was perceived by the rendering engine. resourceType will be one of the following: document, stylesheet, image, media, font, script, texttrack, xhr, fetch, eventsource, websocket, manifest, other. requestBody.contentType - The MIME type of posted data. requestBody.text - The posted data as plain text. responseStatus - The response status. response data - The response data includes the following keys: responsetBody.contentType - The MIME type of received data. responsetBody.text - The received data as plain text. Example 58. Validate the URL of the matching HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET,POST request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL to scenario variable `URL` Then `${URL}` is equal to `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Example 59. Validate the URL query of the matching HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL query to scenario variable `query` Then `${query.q[0]}` is equal to `vividus` Then `${query.q}` is equal to `[vividus]` Then `${query}` is equal to `{q=[vividus]}` Example 60. Validate the request and response data from the matching HTTP messages Given I am on page with URL `http://httpbingo.org/forms/post` When I click on element located by `xpath(//input[@value='cheese'])` When I click on element located by `xpath(//button)` When I capture HTTP POST request with URL pattern `http://httpbingo\\.org/post` and save request data to SCENARIO variable `requestData` Then `${requestData.query}` is equal to `{}` Then `${requestData.resourceType}` is equal to `document` Then `${requestData.requestBody}` is not equal to `null` Then `${requestData.responseStatus}` is equal to `200` When I capture HTTP POST request with URL pattern `http://httpbingo\\.org/post` and save response data to SCENARIO variable `responseData` Then `${responseData.responseBody}` matches `.*\"topping\":.*\"cheese\".*` Waits for the HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and URL regular expression. If no HTTP request is sent and wait timeout is reached, then the step will fail. This step requires network recording to be turned on. It can be done in properties via \"proxy.recording.enabled\" or by switching on \"@proxy\" meta tag at the story or scenario level. When I wait until HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` is captured $httpMethods - The comma-separated HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. GET,POST,PUT. $urlPattern - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL. Example 61. Wait for the HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I wait until HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` is captured The step clears recorded HTTP requests. When I clear network recordings Example 62. Clear the recorded data Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I wait until HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` is captured When I clear network recordings Executes the sequence of web actions.

The main page url value defined by this parameter overrides the value defined by the transformer.from-headless-crawling.main-page-url property. column The column name in the generated table. Example 3. Usage example Examples: {transformer=FROM_HEADLESS_CRAWLING, column=page-url} FROM_HTML transformer generates a table based on the text content, HTML content or attributes of HTML elements found in the requested HTML page. Parameter Name Description pageUrl The URL of the page to build the table upon. The pageUrl parameter is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0, please use variableName instead. The pageUrl parameter can not be used together with the variableName parameter. variableName The name of the variable containing source HTML, only variables of scopes global and next_batches are allowed. Exceptions are cases when the transformer using in step which initializes a variable with a table. The variableName parameter can not be used together with the pageUrl parameter. column The column name in the generated table. xpathSelector The XPath selector to select HTML elements in the HTML page. By using XPath selector we can extract element’s HTML content, attributes and text content like its shown in the following example: //a - extract the link HTML content, e.g. Say Hello //a/text() - extract the link text, e.g. Say Hello //a/@href - extract the link href attribute, e.g. /hello Property Name Acceptable values Default Description transformer.from-html.headers.= Set of headers to set when requesting the page. transformer.from-html.headers.x-vercel-protection-bypass=1fac2b25014d35e5103b Example 4. Given the following HTML page R G B Example 5. Applyng FROM_HTML to the page Examples: {transformer=FROM_HTML, column=relative-url, pageUrl=https://mypage.com, xpathSelector=//a/@href} Example 6. Output table |relative-url| |/r | |/g | |/b | Steps to check resource availability using HTTP requests. Status Description FAILED An HTTP request to the resource returns a status code other than 200 OK. BROKEN Reasons: an HTTP request to the page under test returns an empty HTTP response body; an HTTP request to the page under test results in unexpected error; the relative page URL can not be resolved because the web-application.main-page-url property is not set; the resource has invalid URL format; the resource is missing href or src attributes; the resource has href or src attribute but its value is not a valid URL; the resource is a jump link that points to non-existent jump target. PASSED An HTTP request to the resource returns 200 OK status code. FILTERED Reasons: the resource path matches the patterns specified by the resource-checker.uri-to-ignore-regex property; the resource path is equal to # (anchor); the resource is not a HTTP(S) resource; the resource is jump link which cannot be verified from the current context (if only part of the document is checked). SKIPPED A resource validation has already been performed, i.e. if the same resource might be present on several pages so we do not need to validate it twice. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description resource-checker.publish-response-body true false false Whether to attach the HTTP response body for HTTP calls with non-successful status codes (may reduce performance). Validates resources on web pages. Resource validation logic: If the pages row contains relative URL then it gets resolved against URL in web-application.main-page-url property, i.e. if the main page URL is https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/ and relative URL is /skyrim10 the resulting URL will be https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/skyrim10 Collect elements by the CSS selector from each page Get either href or src attribute value from each element, if neither of the attributes exists the validation fails For each received value execute HEAD request If the status code is 200 OK then the resource validation is considered as passed If the status code is one of 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 501 Not Implemented, 503 Service Unavailable then GET request will be executed If the GET status code is 200 OK then the resource validation is considered as passed, otherwise failed Then all resources found by $htmlLocatorType `$htmlLocator` are valid on:$pages Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): Then all resources by selector `$cssSelector` are valid on:$pages $htmlLocatorType - The HTML locator type, either CSS selector or XPath. $htmlLocator - The actual locator. $pages - The pages to validate resources on. Example 7. Validate resources located by XPath Then all resources found by xpath `//a` are valid on: |pages | |https://vividus.org/ | |/test-automation-made-awesome| Validates resources from HTML document. Resource validation logic: Collects elements by the CSS selector from the specified HTML document Get either href or src attribute value from each element, if neither of the attributes exists the validation fails. If the element value contains relative URL then it gets resolved against URL in web-application.main-page-url property For each received value execute HEAD request If the status code is 200 OK then the resource validation is considered as passed If the status code is one of 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 501 Not Implemented, 503 Service Unavailable then GET request will be executed If the GET status code is 200 OK then the resource validation is considered as passed, otherwise failed Then all resources found by $htmlLocatorType `$htmlLocator` in $html are valid Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): Then all resources by selector `$cssSelector` from $html are valid $htmlLocatorType - The HTML locator type, either CSS selector or XPath. $htmlLocator - The actual locator. $html - HTML document to validate. Example 8. Validate resources from the current page Then all resources found by CSS selector `a,img` in ${source-code} are valid Check that all URLs from ExamplesTable redirect to proper pages with correct redirects number. Validation fails if either actual final URL or number of redirects do not match the expected values. The step throws the error in case if HTTP response status code of checked URL out of range 200-207. Then I validate HTTP redirects: $expectedRedirects $expectedRedirects - The ExamplesTable with redirect parameters containing the following columns: startUrl - The URL from which redirection starts. endUrl - The expected final URL to redirect to. redirectsNumber - The expected number of redirects between startUrl and endUrl (optional). Example 9. Validate redirects Then I validate HTTP redirects: |startUrl |endUrl |redirectsNumber | |http://example.com/redirect |http://example.com/get-response |1 | Performs SSL scanning using SSL Labs and compares received grade value with expected one. Then SSL rating for URL `$url` is $comparisonRule `$gradeName` $url - The URL for SSL scanning and grading. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $gradeName - The name of grade. The possible values: A+, A, A-, B, C, D, E, F, T, M. Table 1. Properties Property Name Acceptable values Default Description ssl-labs.api-endpoint URL https://api.ssllabs.com SSL Labs endpoint. Example 10.

The variable provides the URL of the page currently loaded in the browser. ${current-page-url} Example 5. Validate redirect in the browser Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then `${current-page-url}` is equal to `https://docs.vividus.dev/vividus/latest/index.html` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access height and width of the browser window. Variable name Description browser-window-height the height of the browser window browser-window-width the width of the browser window Example 6. Check the dimension of the browser window When I change window size to `800x600` Then `${browser-window-width}` is = `800` Then `${browser-window-height}` is = `600` Context element rectangle dynamic variables are deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0, please use Save size and coordinates of element step. The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 7. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the current UI context of the application under test. ${context-source-code} Example 8. Firstly check frames on the entire page, and then links in the specified context Given I am on main application page Then all resources by selector `frame,iframe` from ${context-source-code} are valid When I change context to element located by `id(linksList)` Then all resources by selector `a` from ${context-source-code} are valid Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. The variable is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please use ${context-source-code} dynamic variable instead. ${source-code} Example 9. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Profiles allow to choose or parameterize browser that tests run on. See more details on the profiles and nesting strategy on the configuration page. Web-application plugin contains significant number of built-in profiles. They can be found after plugin installation by the following path in Eclipse IDE: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-web-app-X.Y.Z -> properties -> profile -> web Let’s go through the structure and review its content. General place for web profiles. Each of the directory contains browser related properties. This is a place for adjustments for your browser. Add there any properties you need: screen resolution, path to driver or to a custom browser. While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to use custom browser driver. This approach first requires manually downloading the driver (See Quick Reference Section for download links). The path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..driver-executable-path=/path/to/driver/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox safari iexplore edge opera While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to configure path to browser executable file. In general cases it’s not required, installed browsers are found automatically (except Opera browser). Also, for example, if browser is not installed, but only downloaded and unpacked into some folder, the path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..binary-path=/path/to/custom/browser/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox edge opera Profile Example of properties web/desktop/chrome selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments=--disable-auto-reload web/desktop/edge selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=12.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=MicrosoftEdge web/desktop/firefox selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.firefox.command-line-arguments=--turbo web/desktop/iexplore Since Internet Explorer 11 has retired and is officially out of support, this profile is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.8.0. selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=internet explorer web.driver.iexplore.command-line-arguments=-private selenium.grid.capabilities.iedriverVersion=3.141.0 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=7 web/desktop/opera selenium.grid.screen-resolution=1920x1080 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 In order to run tests in Opera browser locally, it is required to configure browser path. web/desktop/safari selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=11.00 Built-in devices Chrome allows to emulate view on mobile devices using Device mode. Such feature is reflected in mobile_emulation subdirectory in Profiles. Use device-name property to mention target device: web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.device-name=DEVICE_NAME Available for emulation devices you can find in the Dimensions list in chrome. Custom devices In case you need to use Responsive Viewport Mode and set up your own device, update the screen resolution in the following properties: web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.width=1440 web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.height=900 Headless mode is a functionality that allows the execution of a full version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display, meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The following profiles running browsers in headless mode are available: web/headless/chrome Profile-specific properties Format Default value Description web.headless.chrome.window-size width,height 800,600 Sets the initial window size. This property is ignored when custom CLI arguments are set using web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments property. web/headless/firefox web/headless/edge The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 10. Run chrome in docker container configuraiton.profiles=web/docker,web/desktop/chrome Contains phone related properties, for android and iOS devices. Profile Example of properties web/phone/android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=Android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=12.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceOrientation=portrait selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=2.0.0 web/phone/ios selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=16.2 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceOrientation=portrait selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=2.0.0 Similar to the Phone directory, but is designed for tablets properties. Profile Example of properties web/tablet selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=14.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceOrientation=landscape selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=1.21.1 By.():->filter.() By. prefix is optional. locatorType - [mandatory] type of the locator locatorValue - [mandatory] value of the locator visibility - [optional] visibility of element (visible by default) filterType - [optional] type of the filter filterValue - [required if filter type defined] value of the filter Feature allows to define custom reusable locator types via properties. These new locator types should rely on one of the already existing ones. Example 11. Properties ui.locator..pattern ui.locator..locator-type locatorName - The name of the reusable locator. Supported characters are A-Z, a-z, -. pattern - The pattern of the reusable locator. locator-type - The base locator type. Example 12. Definition of custom locator ui.locator.anyAttOrText.locator-type=xpath ui.locator.anyAttOrText.pattern=//*[@*='%s' or text()='%s'] Example 13. Usage of custom locator Given I am on main application page Then number of elements found by `anyAttOrText(attribute, text)` is = `1` Example 14. Usage of custom locator with comma in parameter Given I am on main application page Then number of elements found by `anyAttOrText(attribute, with comma\\, text)` is = `1` Description Pattern Usage Result Single parameter doesn’t require comma escaping. //[@='%1$s' or text()='%1$s'] customLocator(Hello, Vlad!) //[@='Hello, Vlad!' or text()='Hello, Vlad!'] The pattern with a single parameter was referenced twice. //[@='%1$s' or text()='%1$s'] customLocator(text) //[@='text' or text()='text'] The pattern with a , in value. //[@='%s' or text()='%s'] customLocator(te\\,xt1, text2) //[@='te,xt1' or text()='text2'] The pattern containing % character //input[@id=\"username\" and text()=\"%%%s\"] customLocator(admin) //input[@id=\"username\" and text()=\"%admin] The pattern without parameters //input[@id=\"username\"] customLocator() //input[@id=\"username\"] The pattern with two parameter placeholders was used with invalid number of parameters. //[@='%s' or text()='%s'] customLocator(text) Exception will be thrown! Type Description Example id Locates elements whose id attribute matches the search value id(submitBtn) cssSelector Locates elements matching a CSS selector cssSelector(.menu-item) xPath Locates elements matching an xPath expression xpath(//a) unnormalizedXPath Locates elements matching an xPath expression. Unlike xPath locator this one doesn’t add space normalization and moves handling of spaces up to user unnormalizedXPath(//li[text()='ID: testId']) tagName name of an element tagName tagName(a) className CSS class name className(bold) linkText text of the link linkText(Google) linkUrl href attribute of the link element linkUrl(/faq) linkUrlPart part of a href attribute of the link element linkUrlPart(faq) caseSensitiveText case sensitive text of an element caseSensitiveText(Description) caseInsensitiveText case insensitive text of an element caseInsensitiveText(description) imageSrc shortcut to a .//img[@src='>'] imgSrc(/images/kote.png) imageSrcPart shortcut to a .//img[contains(@src,'>')]'] imgSrcPart(kote.png) buttonName elements of type button or input with text or any attribute value buttonName(submit) fieldName input or textarea with text or any attribute value fieldName(editor) radioButton input element with @type=\"radio\" and label text value radioButton(One) checkboxName input element with @type=\"checkbox\" and text value checkboxName(allow) elementName any attribute or text value elementName(OK) shadowCssSelector chain of css selectors, separated by ;, where first value - selector for upper shadow host, last value - target element selector shadowCssSelector(.upperHost; #innerHost1; #innerHost2; .targetValue) Visibility type Usage example Description VISIBLE xpath(//a) Default visibility option. Only visible elements will be found INVISIBLE xpath(//a):i Only invisible elements will be found all xpath(//a):a Either visible and invisible elements will be found The filters are applied after elements search using one of the locators specified above. The elements not matching the filter condition are sorted out without any notice. Filter type Description Example index Get an element by the specified index from a collection of elements found by a locator. Indexes start from 1. tagName(div)→filter.index(2) textPart Filter elements by their text parts. tagName(h3)→filter.textPart(Welcome) attribute Filter elements by their attribute values tagName(div)→filter.attribute(class=burger-menu) - div element has the class attribute with burger-menu value tagName(div)→filter.attribute(class) - div element has the class attribute with any value tagName(div)→filter.attribute(class=) - div element has the class attribute with an empty value state element State id(v1)→filter.state(VISIBLE) caseSensitiveText element text should match case sensitively id(v1)→filter.caseSensitiveText(text) classAttributePart class attribute should contain part id(v1)→filter.classAttributePart(clazz) linkUrl href attribute of the link element id(v1)→filter.linkUrl(/url) linkUrlPart part of href attribute of the link element id(v1)→filter.linkUrlPart(/url) tooltip title attribute value id(v1)→filter.tooltip(title) imageSrcPart src attribute should contain value id(v1)→filter.imageSrcPart(part) placeholder Placeholder attribute should be equal to a value id(v1)→filter.placeholder(placeholder-value) validationIconSource CSS property background-image should match id(v1)→filter.validationIconSource(src) fieldText field text should match expected value id(v1)→filter.fieldText(value) fieldTextPart field text should contain expected value id(v1)→filter.fieldTextPart(value) dropDownText any of select options should be equal to a value id(v1)→filter.dropDownText(value) Navigates to the page which was configured as the main application page in the property with name web-application.main-page-url. Given I am on main application page Navigates to the page with the given absolute URL, e.g. https://docs.vividus.dev/. Given I am on page with URL `$pageUrl` Example 15. Open the page with URL https://docs.vividus.dev/ Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Navigates to the page with the given relative URL. When I go to relative URL `$relativeUrl` relativeUrl - A relative URL pointing to a resource within a website (e.g. about.html or /products). If the relative URL starts with '/' char, the navigation will be performed from the root. Otherwise the navigation will be performed from the current URL path. Table 2. Examples Current page URL Relative URL parameter Resulting page URL https://mysite.com about.html https://mysite.com/about.html https://mysite.com /products/new https://mysite.com/products/new https://mysite.com/path/foo stats https://mysite.com/path/foo/stats https://mysite.com/path/foo ./docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo/docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo /documents https://mysite.com/documents Example 16. Open main application page and then navigate to '/products/new' page Given I am on main application page When I go to relative URL `/products/new` Reloads the current page: does the same as the reload button in the browser. When I refresh page Navigates back to the previous page: does the same as the back button in the browser. When I navigate back Checks the page title matches the text according to the given validation rule. Then page title $comparisonRule `$text` $comparisonRule - The page title validation rule. One of the following options: is equal to - validate the page title is equal to $text parameter, contains - validate the page title title contains the string from $text parameter, does not contain - validate the page title title does not contain the value from $text parameter. $text - The text to match according to the rule. Example 17. Validate 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title is equal to `What is VIVIDUS :: VIVIDUS` Example 18. Validate the part of 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title contains `VIVIDUS` The term \"context\" or \"search context\" refers to the area within which the element lookup is performed. By changing the context during the process of locating elements, it is possible to significantly streamline the creation and maintenance of tests. This helps to build more efficient and effective test cases, reducing the time spent interacting with unnecessary elements or searching the entire screen for the desired element. Resets the context, finds the element by the given locator and sets the context to this element if it’s found. When I change context to element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to change context to. Example 19. Change context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` Finds the element by the given locator in the current context and sets the context to this element if it’s found. When I change context to element located by `$locator` in scope of current context Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - The locator used to find the element to change context to. Example 20. Change context in scope of the current context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` When I change context to element located `id(first-row)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `id(table)` is equal to `0` Resets the context if it was set previously. When I reset context Example 21. Reset context behaviour Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `id(table)` Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `id(header)` is equal to `1` Waits for a tab with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until tab with title that $comparisonRule `$title` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a tab in ISO-8601 Durations format. $comparisonRule - The tab title comparison rule. $title - The expected tab title. Example 22. Wait for tab and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/windows.html` When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until tab with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Clicks on the element found by the given locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the element by the given locator; click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is occurred at any atomic action. If the element by the given locator is not clickable (overlapped by another element, page or current context is not loaded properly or the element is disabled) the step will fail with corresponding error: Could not click on the element: org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted: Element Where to Buy is not clickable at point (1619, 275). Other element would receive the click: ... In this case extra steps might be needed to ensure element actionability, like, scrolling to the element, adding waits, etc. When I click on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to click. Example 23. Click on element with name Submit When I click on element located by `name(Submit)` Clicks on the element and checks that the page has not been refreshed after the click. When I click on element located by `$locator` then page does not refresh Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I click on an element '$locator' then the page does not refresh $locator - The locator used to find the element to click. Example 24. Click on the element with id attribute having value send and validate page is not refreshed after the action When I click on element located by `id(send)` then page does not refresh Finds the element by the given locator and performs a right-click in the center of the element if it’s found (at first moves mouse to the location of the element). When I perform right-click on element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I perform right click on element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to right-click. Example 25. Right-click on the element with id attribute having value clickme When I perform right-click on element located by `id(clickme)` Finds the element by the given locator and moves a mouse cursor over the center of the element, if it’s found. When I hover mouse over element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the element to hover mouse over. Example 26. Hover mouse over element with id attribute having value tooltip When I hover mouse over element located by `id(tooltip)` Fields are elements where users can enter data. The most typical fields are: elements, elements, [contenteditable] elements (e.g CKE editors, they are usually located via tag, that is placed in a frame as a separate HTML document). Enter the text in the field found by the given locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the field by the locator; clear the field if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; type the text in the field. When I enter `$text` in field located by `$locator` $text - The text to enter in the field. $locator - The locator used to find the field to enter the text. Example 27. Type text pa$$w0rd in the field with attribute id having value password When I enter `pa$$w0rd` in field located by `id(password)` Enters the text in the field, found by the given locator, without clearing the previous content. When I add `$text` to field located by `$locator` $text - The text to add to the field. $locator - The locator used to find the field to add the text. Example 28. Add text name to the field with attribute id having value username When I add `name` to field located by `id(username)` Finds the field by the given locator and clears it if it’s found. The step does not trigger any keyboard or mouse events on the field. When I clear field located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find the field to clear. Example 29. Clear the field with attribute id having value email When I clear field located by `id(email)` Finds the field by the given locator and clears it using keyboard if the field is found. The step simulates user action by pressing buttons Ctrl+A or Cmd+A and then Backspace that allows to trigger keyboard events on the field. When I clear field located by `$locator` using keyboard $locator - The locator used to find a field. Example 30. Clear the field with attribute id having value email using keyboard When I clear field located by `id(email)` using keyboard Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 31. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located by `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view with centred positioning. If the element to scroll is located inside an overflow container then native scrollIntoView JS method with top alignment is used. When I scroll element located by `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 32. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located by `id(way_down_button)` into view Checks if the page is scrolled to the specific element Then page is scrolled to element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 33. Validate Contact link is scrolled into view Then page is scrolled to element located by `xpath(//a[text()=\"Contact\"])` Validates the context contains the number of elements matching the specified comparison rule. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - The locator used to find elements. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 34. Validate the number of elements Then number of elements found by `xpath(./a)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':v' and 'VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Validate elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':v' and checked state - 'NOT_VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 35. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `id(img)` is = `1` Finds the element by the given locator and saves its text into a variable. When I save text of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find the element whose text content will be saved. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text content. Example 36. Save the text of the header element When I save text of element located by `id(header)` to scenario variable `heading-text` Saves the text of the context element into a variable. An error is thrown if the context is not set to the element. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text content. Example 37. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save text of context element to scneario variable `username` The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched across the whole page. Validates the text is present in the current context. The expected text is case-sensitive. Then text `$text` exists $text - The expected text to be found in the context text. Example 38. Check the text 'Contract Us' is present on the page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then text `Contact Us` exists Validates the text is not present in the current context. Then text `$text` does not exist $text - The text that should not be present in the context. Example 39. Check the text 'Deprecated' is not present in the element When I change context to element located by `id(code)` Then text `Deprecated` does not exist Validates the text from current context matches the specified regular expression. Then text matches `$regex` $regex - The regular expression used to validate the context text. Example 40. Check the text with pattern 'User \".*\" successfully logged in' is present in the current context When I change context to element located by `id(message)` Then text matches `User \".*\" successfully logged in` Opens a new browser tab and switches the focus for future commands to this tab. When I open new tab Example 41. Open page in a new tab When I open new tab Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL. The key difference of this step from the previous one opening a new tab is that this step inherits the state of the previous page, i.e.: new tab will have acces to the session storage of the previous tab, it will be possible to handle alerts appearing on tab closing. When I open URL `$URL` in new tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open. Example 42. Open docs in a new tab When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new tab Closes the current tab and switches to the previous tab. When I close current tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current tab with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open. Example 43. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new tab When I close current tab Trying to close the current tab with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current tab with possibility to handle alert Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current tab was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new tab. If you confirm window close in alert, the tab will be closed, and you will need to switch to current tab using the following step: When I switch to tab with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 44. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new tab When I click on element located by `xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current tab with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Table 3. Possible actions type argument Argument example DOUBLE_CLICK Element locator or empty. By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty. By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point. (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Element locator or empty. By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text to type. Minsk City CLICK Element locator or empty. By.caseSensitiveText(Done) PRESS_KEYS Comma-separated keys to press and release. BACK_SPACE KEY_DOWN Comma-separated keys to press one by one. CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Comma-separated keys to release one by one. CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Element locator. By.id(username) Windows/Unix and macOS platforms have different keyboards. For example, Ctrl+C combination is used to copy text on Windows and Unix, but ⌘ Command+C should be used on macOS with default preferences. In order to close this gap VIVIDUS offers unique key OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL: it is mapped to CONTROL key on Windows/Unix and to COMMAND key on macOS. Using this key it is possible to make tests fully platform independent. Example 45. Execute various web-actions When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | This step can be used to perform clipboard interactions. Example 46. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on Windows When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, CONTROL| Example 47. Paste text from the clipboard to the focused field on MacOS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |COMMAND, v| |KEY_UP |v, COMMAND| Example 48. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on any OS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL| This set of steps allows to validate the browser console logging messages. In order to configure availability of the INFO level messages use following properties: Browser Property to enable INFO logs Google Chrome selenium.capabilities.goog\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Microsoft Edge Chromium selenium.capabilities.ms\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Validates the absence of log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. Example 49. Validate absence of JS errors Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` Then there are no browser console ERRORS Validates the absence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels by regex `$regex` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): Then there are no browser console $logLevels by regex '$regex' $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $regex - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 50. Validate absence of JS error referencing user Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` Then there are no browser console ERRORS by regex `.*user.*` Validates the presence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are browser console $logLevels by regex `$regex` $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $regex - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 51. Validate presence of JS errors referencing user Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` Then there are browser console ERRORS by regex `.*user.*` Waits for the appearance of the console log entries with the expected level and which match regular expression and saves all the entries (including awaited ones) of the expected level gathered during the wait to the scoped variable. Wait uses generic UI timeouts specified by the properties ui.wait.timeout and ui.wait.polling-period. See Properties section for more details. When I wait until browser console $logEntries by regex `$regex` appear and save all entries into $scopes variable `$variableName` $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $regex - The regular expression to match log entry messages. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the value of the barcode. Example 52. Wait for application readiness Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/` When I wait until browser console infos by regex `.*Application ready.*` appear and save all entries into scenario variable `logs` Then `${logs}` matches `.*Application ready in \\d+ seconds.*` Executes the steps against all elements found by locator. After a required number of elements is found, search context switches in order for each found element and performs all steps on it. If comparison rule mismatch steps will not be performed even if elements are found. When I find $comparisonRule `$number` elements by `$locator` and for each element do$stepsToExecute Alias: When I find $comparisonRule '$number' elements by $locator and for each element do$stepsToExecute $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The number of elements to find. $locator - The locator used to find elements. $stepsToExecute - The ExamplesTable with a single column containing the steps to execute. Example 53. Script type check When I find = `5` elements by `xpath(//script):a` and for each element do |step | |When I set 'type' attribute value of the context element to the 'scenario' variable 'type'| |Then `${type}` is equal to `text/javascript` | Switches context to the root element of the current page. When I switch back to page Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch back to the page Example 54. Switch to user context and back to the default context of page Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/elementState.html` When I change context to element located by `id(button-hide)` Then text `Element to hide` does not exist When I switch back to page Then text `Element to hide` exists Switches to or element using one of the supported locators. When I switch to frame located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to frame located `$locator` $locator - Locator of frame element. Example 55. Switch to frame Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/nestedFrames.html` Then text `Modal Frame Example` does not exist When I switch to frame located by `id(parent)` Then text `Modal Frame Example` exists Switch the focus of future browser commands to new tab. This step gets the identifier of the currently active tab and then switches focus to the first available tab with a different identifier. For example, if tabs #1, #2, #3 are open and tab #2 is active, this step will switch focus to tab #3. A new tab should already be open for this step to function. After executing this step, the new tab will become the active tab. When I switch to new tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to a new window Example 56. Open the new tab by link and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows` When I click on element located by `linkUrlPart(/windows/new)` Then text `New Window` does not exist When I switch to new tab Then text `New Window` exists Switch the focus of future browser commands to new tab with specified title. When I switch to tab with title that $stringComparisonRule `$tabName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to window with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName` $stringComparisonRule - String comparison rule. $tabName - The expected tab title. Example 57. Open the new tab by link and switch to it using regex title pattern Given I am on page with URL `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows` When I click on element located by `linkUrlPart(/windows/new)` Then text `New Window` does not exist When I switch to tab with title that matches `.*[wW]indow.*` Then text `New Window` exists Closes the browser. When I close browser Waits for the tab with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until tab with title that $comparisonRule `$title` appears and switch to it Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I wait `$duration` until window with title that $comparisonRule `$windowTitile` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a tab in ISO-8601 Durations format. $comparisonRule - The tab title comparison rule. $title - The expected tab title. Example 58. Wait for tab and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/windows.html` When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until tab with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Stops page loading When I stop page loading Could be useful in combination with Selenium’s page load strategy Example 59. Stop page loading.story When I open URL `https://delayed.vividus.dev` in new tab When I stop page loading Sets a custom page load timeout for a part of the story When I set page load timeout to `$duration` $duration - total duration to wait for page load completion in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 60. Before loading a heavy page set an increased timeout Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I set page load timeout to `PT20S` When I open URL `https://example.com/super-heavy-page` in new tab When I set page load timeout to `PT10S` Checks web performance metrics. Then metric $webPerformanceMetric is $comparisonRule `$duration` $webPerformanceMetric - The web performance metric. Where: TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE - The time between the navigation start and the response start. DNS_LOOKUP_TIME - The time between the domain lookup start and the domain lookup end. DOM_CONTENT_LOAD_TIME - The time between the DOM loading and the the DOM complete. PAGE_LOAD_TIME - The time between the navigation start and the load event end. $comparisonRule - The duration comparison rule. $duration - The duration to compare against in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 61. Check page load Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com` Then metric PAGE_LOAD_TIME is less than `PT5S` Takes a screenshot and publish it to the report. When I take screenshot Takes a screenshot and saves it to the file at the specified path. The full path to the file with the taken screenshot is posted to logs and report. When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `$screenshotFilePath` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I take screenshot and save it to folder `$screenshotFilePath` $screenshotFilePath - The path to the file to save the screenshot, the allowed values are: an absolute path to the file, e.g. C:\\Windows\\screenshot.png; a relative path (it is resolved from the current working directory, e.g. screenshot.png. Example 62. Take a screenshot and save it to the file When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `${screenshot-directory}/start-page.png` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 63. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `id(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 64. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `id(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for an element with the specified state to be found using the specified timeout with polling interval. When I wait `$duration` with `$pollingDuration` polling until element located by `$locator` becomes $state $duration - Total duration to wait in the ISO-8601 format. $pollingDuration - The duration to wait between search retries in the ISO-8601 format. $locator - The locator of the element to wait for state change. $state - The element state. Example 65. Verify that the element become invisible up to 10 times When I wait `PT10S` with `PT1S` polling until element located by `id(element-to-hide)` becomes not visible Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 66. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 67. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Waits for element with the specified locator to stop moving. An element is considered moving when its coordinates (position) are changing. For example, an animated GIF is not a moving element unless it changes position. When I wait until element located by `$locator` stops moving $locator - Locator. Example 68. Wait for element with the specified id to stop moving When I wait until element located by `id(submitForm)` stops moving Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 69. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located by `id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 70. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located by `xpath(//a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Saves the information about the size of an element and its coordinates relative to the viewport.

Resize the browser window Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I change window size to `640x320` A checkbox is a graphical user interface element. Performs the action with the flag found by the locator. Actions that can be performed (CHECK or UNCHECK) When I $checkBoxAction checkbox located by `$checkboxLocator` $checkBoxAction - The action to select a state of the checkbox, either CHECK or UNCHECK. $checkboxLocator - The locator used to identify the checkbox. Example 126. Check 'Terms & Conditions' checkbox When I check checkbox located by `checkboxName(terms-and-conditions)` Steps allow to interact with video elements. Starts video playback. When I play video in video player located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I play video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Pauses video playback. When I pause video in video player located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I pause video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Rewinds video to the desired mark in seconds. When I rewind time to `$number` seconds in video player located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I rewind time to `$number` seconds in video player located `$locator` $number - time mark in seconds $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Saves video player info: duration, currentTime, src, networkState. For more information about the properties see HTML Audio/Video Properties When I save info from video player located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I save info from video player located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find video player. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the info. If the variable name is info, the following variables will be created: ${info.src}- The current source of the audio/video element ${info.duration} - The length of the current audio/video (in seconds) ${info.currentTime} - The current playback position in the audio/video(in seconds) ${info.networkState} - The current network state of the audio/video. For more information see: Network State Example 127. Video player verifications Given I am on page with URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqyVpCV-3c` When I pause video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I rewind time to `777` seconds in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I play video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I save info from video player located `cssSelector(video)` to SCENARIO variable `info` Then `${info.currentTime}` is > `0` Then `${info.duration}` is > `1000` Then `${info.networkState}` is = `2` Then `${info.src}` matches `.+youtube.+` Allows to set command line arguments for browsers. This step works similar to the property: web.driver..command-line-arguments In case both the property and the step are used - arguments from the property will be ignored. The step will take effect for all new browser sessions created in the current story. It will not affect the current sessions. Popular browsers supporting command line arguments configuration: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer. Not supported browsers: Safari When I set browser command line arguments to `$argsString` $argsString - Sequence of command line arguments, separated by space. Example 128. Set the browser to use the mocked camera stream When I set browser command line arguments to `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream --use-file-for-fake-video-capture=${videoStorage}/${video1}.y4m --use-fake-device-for-media-stream` Given I am on main application page Executes async JavaScript code and saves result into variable. When I execute async javascript `$jsCode` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $jsCode - Any JavaScript code. In order to save a result return statement should be used. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie value. Example 129. Validate response When I execute async javascript ` var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1]; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', '/resource/data.json', true); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState == 4) { callback(xhr.responseText); } }; xhr.send();` and save result to scenario variable `response` Then `${response}` matcher `.+` Waits for element appearance with desired timeout. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. Then element located by `$locator` appears in `$timeout` $locator - The locator used to find element. $timeout - The maximum time to wait for the element appearance in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 130. Click on the button and waiting for element appearance for 2 minutes When I click on element located by `buttonName(Show element)` Then element located by 'id(element-to-show)' appears in 'PT2M' Waits for element disappearance with desired timeout. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). Then element located by `$locator` disappears in `$timeout` $locator - The locator used to find element. $timeout - The maximum time to wait for the element disappearance in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 131. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the element for 3 seconds When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' Then element located by 'xpath(//div[@id='delayed'])' disappears in 'PT3S' Waits for an element, located by the specified locator in the given search context, to change to the specified state. Actions performed at this step: finds an element with the specified locator within search context, waits until this element changes to the specified state or timeout is reached. When I wait until state of element located by `$locator` is $state $locator - The locator used to find element. $state - The expected element state. Example 132. Click on the button and wait until the element becomes invisible When I click on element located by `buttonName(hide)` When I wait until state of element located by `xpath(//*[text()='Element to hide']):a` is NOT VISIBLE Waits for an element, located by the specified locator in the given search context, to become stale. When an element becomes stale: the element has been disposed, the element is no longer attached to the DOM. Actions performed at this step: finds an element with the specified locator within search context, waits until this element becomes stale or timeout is reached. When I wait until element located by `$locator` is stale $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 133. Delete element using button and wait until the element disappears from the page When I click on element located by `buttonName(Delete from order)` When I wait until element located by `xpath(//*[text()='Pizza pepperoni']):a` is stale Waits for an element, located by the specified locator in the given search context, to contain the certain text. Actions performed at this step: finds an element with the specified locator within search context, waits until the text in this element becomes visible or timeout is reached. When I wait until element located by `$locator` contains text `$text` $locator - The locator used to find element. $text - The desired text to be present in the element. Example 134. Click on the button and wait until the text in specified element becomes visible When I click on element located by `buttonName(show text)` When I wait until element located by `id(element-with-text)` contains text `Text to show` Waits for the scroll finish. Useful for the cases when page have very slow scroll and need to synchronize the tests with the scroll. When I wait until scroll is finished Example 135. Scroll the page and check that the element in the visible area Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com/pageWithSlowScroll.html` When I click on element located by `id(scrollIt)` When I wait until scroll is finished Then page is scrolled to element located by `id(footerElement)` The Script Steps verify the presence of JavaScript files in the HTML source code of an active page. This step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please see the replacement pattern below: Then number of elements found by `xpath(.//script[contains(@src()='']):a` is equal to `1` Checks script (an element with the tag) with the specified path (@src attribute) is included on the page. Then a javascript file with the name '$jsFileName' is included in the source code $jsFileName - The part of the script resource URL from the @src attribute. Example 136. Checks if the javascript with the 'script.js' filename exists in the page source code Then a javascript file with the name 'script.js' is included in the source code. This step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please see the replacement pattern below: Then number of elements found by `xpath(.//script[text()='']):a` is equal to `1` Checks the page contains a script (an element with the tag) whose content is equal to the specified text. Then a javascript with the text '$jsText' is included in the source code $jsText - The expected text to be equal to the text of a tag. Example 137. Checks if the JavaScript code equals to the expected one Then a javascript with the text 'document.getElementById(\"demo-for-script\").innerHTML = \"Hello JavaScript!\";' is included in the source code This step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0. Please see the replacement pattern below: Then number of elements found by `xpath(.//script[contains(text(),'')]):a` is equal to `1` Checks the page contains a script (an element with the tag) whose content contains the specified text. Then a javascript with the textpart '$jsTextPart' is included in the source code $jsTextPart - The expected text to be contained in the text of a tag. Example 138. Checks if the JavaScript code contains 'Hello JavaScript' Then a javascript with the textpart 'Hello JavaScript' is included in the source code This step allows you to save an HTML table from a specified context into a variable. For more information, see how to work with table variables The HTML table must have a header row with tags. When I save table to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to refer to the variable value. Before using this step, ensure the context is set to the required table. See the example below. Example 139. Save the first table on the page into a variable named 'table' When I change context to element located `xpath(//table[1])` When I save table to SCENARIO variable `table` Saves the number of currently opened tabs in the browser to the variable. When I save number of open tabs to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to refer to the variable value. Example 140. Save the number of currently opened browser tabs into a variable named 'count' When I save number of open tabs to SCENARIO variable `count` Saves the CSS property value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$cssProperty` CSS property value of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cssProperty - The name of an CSS property. $locator - The locator used to find the element to get the CSS property. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the CSS property value. Example 141. Save the CSS property value of the table When I save `padding` CSS property value of element located by `xpath(//table)` to scenario variable `paddingValue` Then `${paddingValue}` is equal to `5px` Accepts the action in popup alert with matching text by clicking on the \"OK\" button or dismiss it by clicking \"Cancel\" button. Actions performed at this step: Finds the appropriate alert with matching message Performs the corresponding action When I $alertAction alert with message which $comparisonRule `$message` $alertAction - Action to perform. Possible values: ACCEPT, DISMISS. $comparisonRule - String comparison rule. $message - The text message of the alert. Example 142. Accept popup alert with any text message When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` This step allows you to type text into popup alert input field and then accept the alert. This step is applicable only for alerts with a single input field. For authorization alerts, basic URL authorization should be used. For example, https://user:pass@domain.com When I type text `$text` in alert and accept it $text - The text to be typed into the alert input field. Example 143. Type text 'VIVIDUS' into alert and close it by clicking OK button When I type text `VIVIDUS` in alert and accept it Waits for an popup alert appearance on the current page. When I wait until alert appears Example 144. Wait untill an alert appear after click on the button When I click on element located by `buttonName(Survey)` When I wait until alert appears Then an alert is present Waits for an popup alert disappearance from the current page. When I wait until alert disappears Example 145. Wait untill an alert disappear after it is accepted When I click on element located by `buttonName(Survey)` Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` When I wait until alert disappears Then an alert is not present Checks that there is popup alert on the page. Then an alert is present Example 146. Check that an alert appears after clicking on the button When I click on element located by `buttonName(Survey)` Then an alert is present Checks that there is no any popup alerts on the page. Then an alert is not present Example 147. Check that an alert doesn’t appear on the page Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` Then an alert is not present Checks that no popup alerts displayed during the timeout. Then alert does not appear in `$timeout` $timeout - Total duration to wait in the ISO-8601 format. Example 148. Check that an alert doesn’t appear within 7 seconds after page loaded Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` Then alert does not appear in `PT7S` Waits for a frame with the specified name to appear and then switches to it. When I wait until frame with name `$frameName` appears and I switch to it $frameName - The name or ID of the expected frame. Example 149. Wait for a frame with cookieFrame name and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` When I wait until frame with name `cookieFrame` appears and I switch to it Waits until the current page title matches the certain title using specified comparison rule. When I wait until page title $comparisonRule `$pattern` $comparisonRule - String comparison rule. $pattern - The expected title pattern of the current page. Example 150. Check that current title ends with \"Domain\" Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` When I wait until page title matches `.*Domain` Steps allow to interact with slider (input element with type = \"range\"). Set the specified value in the slider. When I set value `$value` in slider located by `$locator` $value - The value to set in the slider. In most cases, it is a numeric value in the range of [0, 100]. $locator - The locator used to find a slider. Example 151. Set the value into the middle of the slider When I set value `50` in slider located by `id(test_slider)` Check that the actual value in the slider equals to the value provided in the step. Then value `$value` is selected in slider located by `$locator` $value - The expected value in the slider. In most cases, it is a numeric value in the range of [0, 100]. $locator - The locator used to find a slider. Example 152. Check that the value is set in the middle of the slider Then value `50` is selected in slider located by `id(test_slider)` Emulates mobile device using the provided configuration. The step is only supported by Chrome browser. When I emulate mobile device with configuration:`$jsonConfiguration` $jsonConfiguration - The JSON containing device metrics to override. Example 153. Emulate iPhone 14 Pro Max When I emulate mobile device with configuration:`{ \"width\": 430, \"height\": 932, \"deviceScaleFactor\": 3, \"mobile\": true }` Resets the mobile device emulation returning the browser to its initial state. The step is only supported by Chrome browser. The step ignores the web/desktop/chrome/mobile_emulation/phone profile settings when returning the browser to its initial state. When I reset mobile device emulation Example 154. Resets device metrics to defaults When I reset mobile device emulation To validate host component of the current page URL the following statement can be used: Example 155. Validate host component of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `#{extractHostFromUrl(${current-page-url})}` is equal to `example.com` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. To validate path component of the current page URL the following statement can be used: Example 156. Validate path component of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `#{extractPathFromUrl(${current-page-url})}` is equal to `/relative/url/example.html` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. To validate whether current page URL contains some part the following statement can be used: Example 157. Validate part of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `${current-page-url}` matches `.+\\/relative\\/url.+` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. .\\/relative\\/url. is a regular expression to match the expected part of the page URL.","title":"Web Application

It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. You can run VIVIDUS automated scenarios on mobile devices using Appium tool. Since Appium has a Client/Server Architecture, it is required to install and run Appium server to perform mobile tests. There are two ways of installing Appium server: Application installation (Appium Desktop) Appium Desktop is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any platform. It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server, so you don’t need to worry about Node. Download the latest version of Appium Desktop. Command line installation Appium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed from source or installed directly from NPM: npm install -g appium To run Appium use the command: appium Make sure you have installed: Java Android SDK Xcode (iOS) And the following environment variables are set: JAVA_HOME ANDROID_HOME You can open \"Edit configuration\" to set the variables in Appium Desktop. Read more details for basic Android and iOS setup in Appium Guide. Appium-Doctor diagnoses, reports and fixes common Node, iOS and Android configuration issues before starting Appium. It helps to make sure you have everything to start using Appium. Appium-doctor checks for: Android: Android sdk exists and configured properly; Environment variables and path check; iOS: XCode is installed (with command line tools); Dev tools security check; Auth check; Node binary check; Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and values that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that tell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required capabilities for any Appium driver should include: platformName: the name of the platform to automate platformVersion: the version of the platform to automate deviceName: the kind of device to automate app: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the browserName capability instead in the case of automating a web browser) automationName: the name of the driver you wish to use There are lots of other capabilities. To find out more please see Appium Capabilities Documentation. Before running VIVIDUS scenarios it is necessary to pass Desired Capabilities to Appium Server. Use them as properties with selenium.grid.capabilities. prefix. Then just put these capabilities into the appropriate *.properties file. Please see examples below: Example 1. iOS properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=15.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.ipa Example 2. Android properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=11.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=Pixel 6 selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=UIAutomator2 selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.apk While Android devices require only one additional property, for iOS you need to set three more. See the relevant sections for defining these properties for iOS and Android Appium Inspector is basically just an Appium client with a user interface. It allows to interact with application elements and Appium commands in a user friendly way. You can get the latest version of Inspector application following the link. Click to view capabilities set up in Inspector VIVIDUS Sample Tests is a GitHub repository. Its purpose is to demo VIVIDUS capabilities via sample tests. Let’s use it as an example for running mobile tests via Appium. Assumptions You have installed and properly set up the following: IDE Appium Server AVD Manager (Android) Simulator application (iOS) Cloning and importing the repository Clone vividus-sample-tests project using the following command: git clone --recursive git@github.com:vividus-framework/vividus-sample-tests.git Then use this detailed guide to proceed with importing and building the project. Overriding properties Since we are only interested in the mobile application story, add the following properties to the overriding.properties file. Choose one of the platforms and make sure properties match with your simulator set up. Click to expand overriding.properties Example 3.

Click to view screenshots Appium-Desktop Appium in the terminal Tests execution and expected results Execute the test either via ./gradlew runStories command or by clicking the Run button in the IDE. In case everything has been set up correctly you will see the following: Appium creates a new session; Testing application (Swag Labs Mobile) is installed on the simulator; Application is started; Credentials are entered into username and password fields; After successful login user sees the landing page; Executing tests on real devices has some features and required different preparations depending on the platform. Firstly, make sure you have installed Android Debug Bridge. Simply enter in the command line adb --version. You should get some adb information in the output: adb --version Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 Version 31.0.3-7562133 Installed as /usr/local/bin/adb Connect the device you want to interact with to your workstation. Use adb devices command to see the list of connected devices: adb devices List of devices attached UKjeCe9Mr9 device In this example UKjeCe9Mr9 is the unique identifier of the device. Use that number as a udid capability (property) in VIVIDUS: selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=UKjeCe9Mr9 You are ready to run tests! Just add this property to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Emulators Automating a real device with XCUITest Driver(iOS) is considerably more complicated, due to Apple’s restrictions around running apps on real devices. XCUITest driver installs a helper application called WebDriverAgent-Runner onto the device, and handles the application under test via it. While this is simple in theory, the hoops of code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can make this a bit of a headache. There are two approaches for WebDriverAgent configuration: Automatic WDA configuration. Proper work of the WDA requires signing it with a valid Apple Developer account. If you have a paid Apple Developer account, please see the following instructions on Appium Doc; Manual WDA configuration. Using a \"Free\" developer account often leads to issues with the impossibility of creating a wildcard provisioning profile for the default application bundle. Follow the instructions below to handle this issue. The next steps are based on Appium manual configuration doc. Add a new Apple Development Certificate for your Apple ID; Click to see details Open Xcode and go to settings Click \"+\" to add an account and then Sign In with your Apple ID Add a new Apple Development Certificate Build WebDriverAgent signed with your newly created certificate; Open WDA project in Xcode; Most common path to the project: /Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj Come up with your unique Bundle Identifier. Use it for updating build parameters. Click to see details Make sure you’ve chosen correct device and parameters image::appium-check-device-and-parameters.png[] Create your unique BundleId and update build parameters image::appium-update-build-parameters.png[] Build the project Click to see details # iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeSigningId=Apple Development(1) selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=b3f34105281bb345p980p824401d5913f13efe81(2) selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeOrgId=5H8S64Q9G4(3) selenium.grid.capabilities.updatedWDABundleId=yourUniqueBundleId.WebDriverAgentRunner(4) 1 xcodeSigningId For any Apple device use Apple Development as the xcodeSigningId property. 2 UDID Make sure your Apple device is connected; Open Finder and choose your device; Copy udid from the device information; Click to view screenshots 3 xcodeOrgId Open KeyChain Access application; Go to Default Keychains → Login; Open My Certificates tab and find certificated you have created recently; Open Certificate and use Organisational Unit parameter as xcodeOrgId property; Click to view screenshots 4 updatedWDABundleId Use your unique Bundle Identifier that was created previously as updatedWDABundleId property; When all tools are installed and set up and all desired capabilities are defined, we can start our tests. For the first time, Appium will install the WDA application on the Apple device. Since WDA is signed with an unknown Apple Developer account, we need to add it to the trust. Start the session either via Appium Inspector or by running an autotest. Once the WDA icon appears on the screen, do the following: Go to Settings→General→Profile & Device Management (iOS 15 and higher - Settings→General→VPN & Device Management); Tap on \"Apple Development: \"account name\"; Choose \"Trust\"; Click to view screenshot You are ready to run tests! Just add properties from above to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Simulators Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Make sure adb sees the device (adb devices). In case the device is not on the list, try restarting adb server via terminal: adb kill-server && \\ adb start-server WDA is expired. This is the most common issue that appeared on iOS devices Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65 When it happens, the icon of the WebDriverAgent disappears from the device menu. To get it back on the device you should rebuild WDA for your device and add your developer account to trust again; Use this guide to fix WDA expiration much faster Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Yes. You can create the second application signed with your Apple Developer account. Once WebDriverAgent get expired, it will be deleted. But your second app will remain on the device and keep your Apple Developer account in the trusted list. You will only need to rebuild WDA in a click to get it back. Click to expand steps Make sure your device is connected to your workstation; Open Xcode and create a new project; Choose Application type \"App\" for your platform; Enter Product Name, let’s say \"keeper\"; Use the same Team and Organization Identifier that you used for WebDriverAgent; Click Build; Now your mobile device has the keeper application installed.

The database is deployed on tests start, accessible from tests and shutdown on tests end. The test data can be created from SQL files located in the project. Add the required dependencies (DB plugin, H2 database) to the project build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.6.13-SNAPSHOT') implementation(group: 'com.h2database', name: 'h2', version: '2.3.230') Configure connection to the H2 database and initialization DDL/DQL scripts could be run using either INIT property of the connection string or the step executing SQL queries. Whichever method of database initialization is chosen, RUNSCRIPT statement with the path to SQL files could be used. Here you can specify absolute path to file or use the 'classpath:/' prefix - files will be searched from 'src/main/resources' folder relatively. The details on executing SQL statements on connection could be found in the official H2 guide. 2.1 Configure using INIT property using INIT property data loaded into the database once and can no longer be change. Example 1. Configure connection and initialization of the database db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ INIT=create schema if not exists test\\\\;\\ SET SCHEMA test\\\\;\\ DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.students\\\\;\\ CREATE TABLE test.students (firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)\\\\;\\ INSERT INTO students (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Maria', 'Miller')\\\\; db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= Example 2.

Example 3. Configure connection to database db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1; db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= If you are using database initialization in the step, do not forget to set the property DB_CLOSE_DELAY.
