Synonyms: examples table, data table. ExamplesTable represents a tabular structure that holds rows of example data for parameters named via the column headers: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| Rows starting with an ignorable separator (defaults to |--) are allowed and ignored: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |-- A commented row --| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |-- Another commented row --| |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The separators are also configurable via inlined properties: {ignorableSeparator=!--,headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!} !header 1!header 2! .... !header n! !-- A commented row --! !value 11!value 12! .... !value 1n! ... !-- Another commented row --! !value m1!value m2! .... !value mn! Comments in column values are supported via the commentSeparator inlined property: {commentSeparator=#} | header 1#comment | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11#comment | value 12 | .... | value 1n | Comments including the separator are stripped. By default all column values are trimmed. To avoid trimming the values, use the trim inlined property: {trim=false} | header 1 | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11 | value 12 | .... | value 1n | By default, all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However, it might be required to map certain values to null-s. This can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| Line break is a default separator for rows in ExamplesTable, that’s why they can’t be added as is to the data. In order to put value with line breaks to ExamplesTable escape sequences (a character preceded by a backslash \\ is an escape sequence) must be used. Escape Sequence Description \\n< Insert a newline in the value at this point. \\r Insert a carriage return in the text at this point. \\\\ Insert a backslash character in the text at this point. The inlined property processEscapeSequences defines whether escape sequences should be replaced in the data. It’s false by default (no property is declared explicitly). The allowed values are true and false, any other values are considered invalid and will lead to parsing error. {processEscapeSequences=true, commentSeparator=#} |header | |line 1\\nline 2 |# The value with a newline |line 1\\r\\nline 2|# The value with a carriage return and a newline |line 1\\\\nline 2 |# The value with an escaped escape sequence, the result will be \"line 1\\nline 2\" Synonyms: VIVIDUS expression. An expression is a special placeholder which is detected, evaluated and resolved during test execution. Expressions are used for the data generation and transformation. General expression syntax is: #{expression} During resolution process the expression placeholder is replaced with the result of the expression evaluation. If expression is unknown for VIVIDUS, the placeholder will be kept as is. If expression evaluation results in error, it will be propagated to the top level and the test will be marked as broken. It’s allowed to construct nested expressions: in this case the evaluation starts with the deepest expression. Expressions may include any number of variables placeholders. Synonyms: project resource, test resource. A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExamplesTable transformer. ExamplesTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\. Example 1. Escaping special characters in transformer properties {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER, countries=\\{Australia\\,Canada\\}} In the example above the transformer will have a single property with name countries and value {Australia,Canada}. VIVIDUS variables of scopes global and next batches can be used in transformer properties (pay attention to escapes of the variables placeholders in the example below). Example 2. Usage of global variable ${locale} in transformer property {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER, tables=/$\\{locale\\}/table1.table;/$\\{locale\\}/table2.table}","title":"Glossary","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"glossary","url":"/vividus/latest/glossary.html","titles":[{"text":"ExamplesTable","hash":"_examplestable","id":1},{"text":"Preserving whitespace","hash":"_preserving_whitespace","id":2},{"text":"Mapping values to null-s","hash":"_mapping_values_to_null_s","id":3},{"text":"Using values with line breaks","hash":"_using_values_with_line_breaks","id":4},{"text":"Expression","hash":"_expression","id":5},{"text":"Resource","hash":"_resource","id":6},{"text":"Table Transformer","hash":"_table_transformer","id":7}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"VIVIDUS is a test automation tool that offers already implemented solution for testing of most popular application types.

Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued. The following properties are used to configure batches (VIVIDUS doesn’t provide any default batch configuration out of the box). batch-number is one-based batch index. The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property Default value Description batch-.resource-location The test project path to the folder with story-files batch-.resource-include-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be included in the batch. Leading and trailing whitespaces in patterns are omitted. batch-.resource-exclude-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be excluded from the batch.

For example dry-run could be useful to debug what stroies will be executed with provided config. bdd.configuration.skip-story-if-given-story-failed false Skips the story in case of failure in the given story bdd.configuration.formats JSON,XML Available formats of the output files with test execution results statistics.print-failures false If set to true prints table of failures including: story, scenario, step and error message report.text-length-diff-threshold 100 Defines text threshold length to enable unified diff report publishing on failure, for variable comparisons. If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question \"What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?\". These specifics (properties) should be written in the profile.properties file. Path to this file is set in configuration.properties file: Example 2. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=web It’s allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones. Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into profile.properties files in appropriate places. Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution. Let’s create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let’s see profiles structure for this case: └─ src/main/resources/properties └─ profile (1) ├─ web (2) ├─ chrome (4) └─ profile.properties (6) ├─ firefox (4) └─ profile.properties └─ profile.properties (5) ├─ mobile_app (2) ├─ iOS (7) └─ profile.properties ├─ android (7) └─ profile.properties (9) └─ profile.properties (8) └─ profile.properties (3) 1 Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties; 2 General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device; 3 The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device; 4 Web browsers' profiles (directories); 5 Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles; 6 Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices; 7 Mobile profiles (directories); 8 Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only; 9 Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup; By default, profile property is pointed to the /src/main/resources/properties/profile directory, so use the relative path starting from profile when you have nested directories: Example 3. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android Some of the plugins, like web-app, have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers. Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration. Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into environment.properties file. The path to this file is set in configuration.properties file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them: Example 4. configuration.properties configuration.environments=dev #configuration.environments=test #configuration.environments=prod Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the same approach of reusing and separating values. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 5. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 6. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @severity 1 @layout desktop Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.epam.com/' Then the page title is equal to 'EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting' Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @severity 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://www.google.com/' Then the page title is equal to 'Google' The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 7. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 8. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 9. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 10. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @severity Numeric values (range 1-5) Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important Test, the highest number is the least important. @severity 1 @layout desktop, phone, phone_portrait, phone_landscape, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet, tablet_landscape, tablet_portrait Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 11. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 12. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests. GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues. AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all. RED 3 Test report isn’t generated. Common errors: \"InvalidConfigurationException: No batches with tests to execute are configured\" - the configured suite has 0 batches, i.e. no tests to execute are configured. RED Here one could find description of general HTTP properties applied across all the HTTP interactions in VIVIDUS. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description General http.circular-redirects-allowed boolean false Allow circular redirects (redirects to the same location) http.connection-request-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the client connections pool. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.connect-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.max-total-connections integer 80 The number of maximum total connections for the client connections pool http.max-connections-per-route integer 60 The number of maximum connections per route for the client connections pool http.socket-timeout integer 3000 The timeout in milliseconds used for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.cookie-spec default, ignoreCookies, standard-strict, standard, netscape default The name of the cookie specification to be used for HTTP state management Authentication http.auth.username character sequence The username, presence of this property requires the http.auth.password to be also set http.auth.password character sequence The password, presence of this property requires the http.auth.username to be also set http.auth.preemptive-auth-enabled boolean false If enabled the HTTP client will send the basic authentication data even before the service gives an unauthorized response (401), useful when the service doesn’t support unauthorized response (401) or to reduce the overhead of making the connection SSL handshake http.ssl.check-certificate boolean true Verify certificates sent by the server during SSL handshake, the most common errors occured during verfication are Expired SSL Certificate Error, SSL Certificate Not Trusted Error, SSL Certificate Revoked Error etc. http.ssl.verify-hostname boolean true Verify if the domain name in the SSL certificate matches the domain name in URL where the request is sent to Two-Way SSL authentication http.key-store.type KeyStore types JKS The key store type http.key-store.path Resource The key store to load http.key-store.password string The password used to unlock the key store and for the integrity checking http.ssl.private-key-password string The password for the private key DNS resolver http.local-dns-storage. key-value mapping The property prefix used to override the OS DNS lookup by specifying hostname to IP address mappings e.g. http.local-dns-storage.coursera.org=52.84.197.20 Service unavailability retry handler http.service-unavailable-retry.max-retries integer 1 The maximum number of allowed retries if the server responds with a HTTP code specified in http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes property http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes set of integers The set of HTTP status codes to be retried. If it’s empty, no retries will be performed http.service-unavailable-retry.retry-interval ISO-8601 duration PT1S The retry interval between subsequent requests Idempotent retry handler http.idempotent-methods-sending-request-body set of integers The list of HTTP methods containing request body which should be treated as idempotent for retries Most common use cases for externalized configuration are tests parametrization with properties passed from CI/CD pipeline, passing of secrets into test run etc. The available approaches are listed below. Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value bdd.variables.global.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.bdd.variables.global.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.bdd.variables.global.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. Generate the overriding.properties file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project. The following script assumes that we are in the root of the test project folder. cat > src/main/resources/overriding.properties << EOD bdd.variables.global.some-key-1=value1 bdd.variables.global.some-key-2=value2 EOD This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. VIVIDUS allows to store values of the properties in the encrypted form. VIVIDUS uses Jasypt (Java Simplified Encryption) which provides two-way encryption mechanism. While performing two-way encryption, apart from feeding plain-text it’s required to feed the secret text (i.e. password) and this secret text is used to decrypt the encrypted text. The default encryption algorithm is PBEWithMD5AndDES. Download the latest Jasypt release Unpack the downloaded zip-archive Go to bin folder Run the command perfoming encryption: Example 13. Windows: encrypt.bat input=\"This is my message to be encrypted\" password=MYPAS_WORD Example 14. Linux/UNIX/macOS: ./encrypt.sh input=\"This is my message to be encrypted\" password=MYPAS_WORD where input - Any string to be encrypted. password - Your encryption password. MYPAS_WORD is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption. Find the encrypted data in OUTPUT section Example 15. Encryption command output ----ENVIRONMENT----------------- Runtime: Eclipse Adoptium OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17+35 ----ARGUMENTS------------------- input: This is my message to be encrypted password: MYPAS_WORD ----OUTPUT---------------------- WVnXhzG704KRZZFYL7hfpA4YoSm8V2F5eNXyr7CRYCichteHvNS3nB23zaI8CuLy Find more details in Jasypt CLI Tools documentation Use this tool at your own risk, since there is a chance of potential leakage of sensitive data Paste plain text string to encrypt to the corresponding text field. Set Type of Encryption to \"Two Way Encryption (With Secret Text)\". Enter secret key/text in the corresponding text field. Click \"Encrypt\". The resulting encrypted string can be copied from the corresponding field. Set the password in one of the following ways: Pass the key with its password-value into a test run using command line: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.encryptor.password=MYPAS_WORD Add the password to the system project properties as the value of: system.vividus.encryptor.password=MYPAS_WORD Set via OS environment variable VIVIDUS_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD Keep in mind that a password specified in the command line takes priority over the project system property, and the project system property takes priority over the environment variable. This password must be kept secret and must not be committed to version control system. MYPAS_WORD is a sample password and should be never used, own strong password is required for the encryption.

VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let’s take the following step: Example 16. VIVIDUS step When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` Create a new JSON file (for example, aliases/aliases.json) and put the following content with one or more aliases: Example 17. aliases/aliases.json [ { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`\", \"aliases\": [ { \"name\": \"When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `$locator`\" }, { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse pointer over web element located `$locator`\" } ] } ] Point the alias configuration property to an exact location or location pattern with the JSON files containing ailases: engine.alias-paths=aliases/aliases.json Use the defned alias in place of actual step in your story When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `id(loginButton)`","title":"Tests Configuration","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"tests-configuration","url":"/vividus/latest/tests-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"configuration.properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":1},{"text":"Suites","hash":"_suites","id":2},{"text":"Profiles","hash":"_profiles","id":3},{"text":"Profiles setup","hash":"_profiles_setup","id":4},{"text":"Built-in profiles","hash":"_built_in_profiles","id":5},{"text":"Environments","hash":"_environments","id":6},{"text":"Known Issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":7},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":8},{"text":"Known Issues file","hash":"_known_issues_file","id":9},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":10},{"text":"Meta tags","hash":"_meta_tags","id":11},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":12},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_2","id":13},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":14},{"text":"1D tags (@key)","hash":"_1d_tags_key","id":15},{"text":"2D tags (@key  value)","hash":"_2d_tags_key_value","id":16},{"text":"Story Prioritization","hash":"_story_prioritization","id":17},{"text":"Exit codes","hash":"_exit_codes","id":18},{"text":"HTTP Configuration","hash":"_http_configuration","id":19},{"text":"Externalized Configuration","hash":"_externalized_configuration","id":20},{"text":"Sensitive Data Encryption","hash":"_sensitive_data_encryption","id":21},{"text":"How to encrypt a string","hash":"_how_to_encrypt_a_string","id":22},{"text":"Option 1 (Recommended): using Jasypt CLI","hash":"_option_1_recommended_using_jasypt_cli","id":23},{"text":"Option 2: using Jasypt Online","hash":"_option_2_using_jasypt_online","id":24},{"text":"How to use an encrypted string in VIVIDUS","hash":"_how_to_use_an_encrypted_string_in_vividus","id":25},{"text":"Steps aliases","hash":"_steps_aliases","id":26},{"text":"How to use steps aliases","hash":"_how_to_use_steps_aliases","id":27}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"In scope of this article the task term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities and that produces some output based on the work done.

In this case - Internet. Click on its name to see the methods it contains. 3 One of the available methods within Internet data provider - password. There are multiple choices, we picked the fourth one. 4 Available parameters for the chosen method. There are three of them: int minimumLength - minimum number of symbols; int maximumLength - maximum number of symbols; boolean includeUppercase - true or false for Uppercase usage; In this way we created an expression that generates a password from 5 to 10 characters length including uppercase letters. Possible output is 51gVj5aLZY Replaces ? symbols with latin letters. #{generate(letterify '$input', '$isUpperCase')} $input - any string containing ? symbols to be replaced with letters $isUpperCase - boolean, set it to true for uppercase option Table 1. letterify examples Expression Result #{generate(letterify 'test????test')} testnjmytest #{generate(letterify 'test????test', 'true')} testXQBMtest Replaces # symbols with numbers. #{generate(numerify '$input')} $input - any string containing # symbols to be replaced with numbers Table 2. numerify example Expression Result #{generate(numerify 'test####test')} test5862test Combination of letterify and numerify. #{generate(bothify '$input')} $input - any string containing # and ? symbols to be replaced with numbers and letters accordingly Table 3. bothify example Expression Result #{generate(bothify 'test#?#?#?#test')} test2o7v0g9test Replaces symbol mentioned in the second argument with one of the symbols mentioned after it. #{generate(templatify '$input', '$whatToReplace', '$replacement1', '$replacement2', '$replacement3')} $input - any string to process $whatToReplace - part of the string to be replaced $replacement - replacement to use.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regaular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story. Variables are invalidated once the story is completed. next_batches Variables are available in the next batches. next_batches-scoped variable is not available in batch it’s declared within. batch Such variables are declared only with bdd.variables.batch-. prefix and available throughout the execution of the batch in the suite. An attempt to create the batch-scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 1. Declaring batch variable locale bdd.variables.batch-1.locale=/us/en/ bdd.variables.batch-2.locale=/uk/en/ Example 2. Using batch variable locale Given I am on the main application page When I go to the relative URL '${locale}' global Such variables are declared only via properties with bdd.variables.global. prefix and available throughout the entire execution. An attempt to create the globally scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 3. Declaring global variable login-endpoint bdd.variables.global.login-endpoint=https://my-auth-server.com/api/login Example 4. Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `${login-endpoint}` Then the response code is equal to '200' It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 5. Declaring global variable with expression random-user bdd.variables.global.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 6. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `/authenticate` Then the response code is equal to '200' Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, batch-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 7. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario Given I initialize scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` Given I initialize story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario.","title":"Variables","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"variables","url":"/vividus/latest/commons/variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution","id":1},{"text":"Regular variables","hash":"_regular_variables","id":2},{"text":"Scopes","hash":"_scopes","id":3},{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution_2","id":4}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Here one could find description of the steps that are delivered with Vividus itself without any plugins required.

Example 1. jira.properties jira.vividus.project-key-regex=(VIVIDUS|VSCODE|REACTAPP) jira.vividus.endpoint=https://vividusframework.atlassian.net/ jira.vividus.http.auth.username=admin jira.vividus.http.auth.password=5401a7d27b291c5d jira.vividus.http.socket-timeout=10000 jira.vividus.fields-mapping.test-case-type=customfield_10002 In the example above the vividus is a key that can be used to refer this JIRA instance. Property Required Description zephyr.exporter.api-type false The type of Jira API (SCALE, SQUAD). The SCALE type is selected by default. Zephyr Squad (formerly \"Zephyr for Jira\") provides base functionality for test case management easy to start, easy to use. More info Zephyr Scale (formerly \"Test Management for Jira\") provides advanced test case management capabilities, such as cross-project test management solution with advanced test planning, reporting, and reusability features. More info zephyr.exporter.jira-instance-key false The key of the configured JIRA instance, in case of missing value it will be evaluated automatically based on issue keys being exported zephyr.exporter.source-directory true Path to directory with test execution JSON results. zephyr.project-key true Key of a Jira project where new test executions should be created zephyr.version-name true Version/release name where new test executions should be created zephyr.cycle-name true Cycle/sprint name where new test executions should be created zephyr.folder-name false Folder name where new test executions should be created The following properties are applicable only for Squad zephyr.exporter.statuses-of-test-cases-to-add-to-execution false List of test case statuses for adding to execution. zephyr.exporter.update-execution-statuses-only false Property for update existing executions statuses only. The Zephyr plugin for Jira has own configurable execution statuses. testExecutionStatus endpoint is used to get the detailed information about the statuses, like: https://jira.example.com/rest/zapi/latest/util/testExecutionStatus. The following properties are used to setup a mapping between Vividus and Zephyr execution statuses. This approach is similar for both API types (Scale and Squad), the major differences are Zephyr Scale has fewer test case statuses by default and the status representation during import (for Scale status transmitted in text format, like: Failed (Fail), but for Squad it transmitted in number format (status code), like: 7). Vividus execution status property name Zephyr Squad execution status value (by default) Zephyr Scale execution status value zephyr.statuses.FAILED FAILED Fail zephyr.statuses.BROKEN TEST NEEDS REWORK Fail zephyr.statuses.PENDING TEST NEEDS REWORK In Progress zephyr.statuses.UNKNOWN PASSED WITH REMARKS Pass zephyr.statuses.SKIPPED SCHEDULED Not Executed zephyr.statuses.PASSED PASSED Pass If the authentication through basic schema is available on your JIRA instance use jira..http.auth.username and jira..http.auth.password properties, both properties must be set. jira..http.auth.username=admin jira..http.auth.password=5401a7d27b291c5d In case of two-factor authentication or any other complex authentication process it’s possible to set session cookies into request headers like the following example shows (jira..http.auth.username and jira..http.auth.password properties must be empty in this case). jira..http.headers.Cookie=SESSIONID=298zf09hf012fh2 Name Example Description testCaseId @testCaseId TEST-1 Add test execution to Jira test case Example 2.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

Invoke AWS Lambda function by providing the function name and the payload to pass to the Lambda function. When I invoke AWS Lambda function `$functionName` with payload `$payload` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $functionName - The name of AWS Lambda function, version, or alias. The value can be retrieved by looking at the function in the AWS Console. Supported name formats: Function name: my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias). Function ARN: arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function. Partial ARN: 123456789012:function:my-function. It’s allowed to append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If only the function name is specified, it is limited to 64 characters in length. $payload - The JSON that to provide to AWS Lambda function as input. Vividus performs a Base64 encoding on this field before sending this request to the AWS service. Users should not perform Base64 encoding on this field. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store results. If the variable name is my-var, the following variables will be created: ${my-var.payload} - the response from the function, or an error object ${my-var.status-code} - the HTTP status code is in the 200 range for a successful request ${my-var.log-result} - the last 4 KB of the execution log ${my-var.executed-version} - the version of the function that executed, when it’s invoked a function with an alias, this indicates which version the alias resolved to ${my-var.function-error} - if present, indicates that an error occurred during function execution, details about the error are included in the response payload Example 2. Invoke AWS Lambda When I invoke AWS Lambda function `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function` with payload ` { \"Hello \": \"Paris\", \"countryCode\": \"FR\" } ` and save result to scenario variable `my-function-result`","title":"AWS Lambda Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-aws-lambda","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-aws-lambda.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Authentication","hash":"_authentication","id":3},{"text":"Region Selection","hash":"_region_selection","id":4},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":5},{"text":"Invoke AWS Lambda function","hash":"_invoke_aws_lambda_function","id":6}]},"31":{"id":31,"text":"The plugin provides functionality to interact with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

Upload the specified data to Amazon S3 under the specified bucket and key name. When I upload data `$data` with key `$objectKey` and content type `$contentType` to S3 bucket `$bucketName` $data - the data to be uploaded $objectKey - the key under which to store the specified data $contentType - the MIME type of data $bucketName - the name of an existing bucket Example 2. Upload data to Amazon S3 When I upload data `{\"my\":\"json\"}` with key `folder/name.json` and content type `application/json` to S3 bucket `testBucket` Retrieve the object by key from the provided S3 bucket and save its content to a variable. The specified bucket and object key must exist, or an error will result. When I fetch object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $objectKey - the key under which the desired object is stored $bucketName - the name of the bucket containing the desired object $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - the variable name Example 3. Download S3 object When I fetch object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `my-json-var` Set the canned access control list (ACL) for the specified object in Amazon S3. Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy. When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error. When I set ACL `$cannedAcl` for object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` $cannedAcl - The new pre-configured canned ACL for the specified object. (See the official documentation for a complete list of the available ACLs) $objectKey - The key of the object within the specified bucket whose ACL is being set. $bucketName - The name of the bucket containing the object whose ACL is being set Example 4. Set public READ permission When I set ACL `public-read` for object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` Collects a list of the S3 objects keys in the specified bucket. Because buckets can contain a virtually unlimited number of keys, the complete results can be extremely large, thus it’s recommended to use filters to retrieve the filtered dataset. When I collect objects keys filtered by:$filters in S3 bucket `$bucketName` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $filters - The ExamplesTable with filters to be applied to the objects to limit the resulting set. Table 1. The supported filter types Type Alias Description KEY_PREFIX key prefix The prefix parameter, restricting to keys that begin with the specified value KEY_SUFFIX key suffix The suffix parameter, restricting to keys that end with the specified value OBJECT_MODIFIED_NOT_EARLIER_THAN object modified not earlier than The ISO-8601 date, restricting to objects with last modified date after the specified value The filters can be combined in any order and in any composition. Example 5. The combination of filters |filterType |filterValue | |key suffix |.txt | |object modified not earlier than|2021-01-15T19:00:00+00:00 | $bucketName - The name of the S3 bucket which objects keys are to be collected $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the S3 objects keys. The keys are accessible via zero-based index, ${my-keys[0]} will return the first found key. Example 6. Download the first found S3 object with the specified prefix When I collect objects keys filtered by: |filterType |filterValue | |key prefix |folder/ | in S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `s3-keys` When I fetch object with key `${s3-keys[0]}` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `s3-object` Delete the specified object in the specified bucket. Once deleted, the object can only be restored if versioning was enabled when the object was deleted. If attempting to delete an object that does not exist, Amazon S3 returns a success message instead of an error message. When I delete object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` $objectKey - The key of the object to delete. $bucketName - The name of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the object to delete.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for Java, which defines how a client may access a database. Every JDBC requires using specific driver. JDBC drivers are client-side adapters (installed on the client machine, not on the server) that convert requests from Java programs to a protocol that the database management system (DBMS) can understand. Copy the below line code to dependencies section of the project build.gradle file Example 1. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.5.2-SNAPSHOT') Define your JDBC driver and add appropriate dependency. Let’s take PostgreSQL as an example: Open JDBC page on maven repository; Find driver for your database and open details (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver); Choose and open version (42.4.0); Go to the Gradle tab and copy implementation string; Paste chosen dependency into your build.gradle file: Example 2. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.4.0') In case Maven repository does not contain driver you need, please refer to the documentation of your database to define suitable JDBC driver. If the project was imported to the IDE before adding new plugin, re-generate the configuration files for the used IDE and then refresh the project in the used IDE. For database interaction, you will need to set related properties. They have db.connection. prefix followed by the database connection name (vividus in the example). Come up with your own database name to use within the tests. Put properties into the environment.properties file: Example 3. environment.properties db.connection.vividus.url=jdbc:dbms://databaseUrl:port/databaseName?parameter1=true¶meter2=value (1) db.connection.vividus.username= (2) db.connection.vividus.password= (2) db.connection.vividus.driver-class-name=(3) 1 Database address. Consists of: jdbc: - reference to JDBC; dbms: - Database Management System, e.g. postgresql; //databaseUrl - address to your database; :port - port number, e.g. 5432; /databaseName - name of your database; parameters - any additional driver parameters you need to pass; URL structure slightly changes depending on the database management system. You can find templates for different DBMS in setup examples. 2 Credentials for given database connection; 3 Driver class name (Optional), e.g. org.postgresql.Driver.

Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 10. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Given I start mobile application Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides gloablly-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilies have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 11. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 12. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 13. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 14. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Runs mobile application in the backround for specific period of time and either activates the app after a certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated (when PT-1S is used). See Appium docs for more details. When I send mobile application to background for `$period` period $period - The period of time in ISO-8601 format. Example 15. Run app in background When I send mobile application to background for `PT5S` period Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(login-button)` is equal to `1` Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The settings to set. Example 16. Configure to show invisible elements When I change Appium session settings: |name |value| |allowInvisibleElements|true | Uploads a file to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. Example 17. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image Deletes a file from the device/emulator/simulator. When I delete file `$filePath` from device Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to delete a file or a folder from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type is 'documents'. If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a file inside an application bundle /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle Example 18. Delete file When I delete file `/sdcard/Pictures/avatar.png` from device On iOS real device to add or delete photo or video to/from \"Camera Roll\" you need upload/delete photos or videos to/from /DCIM/100APPLE/ folder and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. Restart device is necessary after that. On iOS simulator to delete photo or video from \"Camera Roll\" you need to delete photo or video from /Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. And then restart simulator.

It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 38.

Example 22. Check HTTP response content type When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/robots.txt` Then value of response header `Content-Type` is equal to `text/plain` Validates that the response header with the specified name contains elements. Might be useful to verify such HTTP headers as Set-Cookie that have values that can be decomposed into multiple elements. Example 23. HTTP header with elements format header = [ element ] *( \",\" [ element ] ) Then response header `$headerName` contains elements:$elements $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $attributes - The ExamplesTable with expected elements. Example 24. Check attributes of Set-Cookie header When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/authenticate` Then response header `Set-Cookie` contains elements: |element | |JSESSION| |clientId| Saves the HTTP response header value into a variable. When I save response header `$headerName` value to $scopes variable `$variableName` $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the header value. Example 25.

Then connection is secured using $securityProtocol protocol $securityProtocol - The expected security protocol, e.g. TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 Example 26. Check that the httpbin is secured When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/` Then connection is secured using TLSv1.2 protocol Waits for a specified amount of time until HTTP response body contains an element by the specified JSON path. The actions of the step: Execute sub-steps. Check if the HTTP response is present and the response body contains an element by JSON path. If the required JSON element exists or the maximum number of retries is reached, then the execution stops, otherwise the step actions are repeated. Stop step execution if HTTP response is not present or JSON element is found, otherwise sleep for the calculated part of specified duration and repeat actions from the start. When I wait for presence of element by `$jsonPath` for `$duration` duration retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute $jsonPath - The JSON path of the element to find. $duration - The time duration to wait in ISO-8601 format. $retryTimes - The maximum of attempts. duration/retryTimes = timeout is a polling timeout between requests. $stepsToExecute - The sub-steps to execute at each iteration. Example 27. Wait for presence of element 10 times with polling timeout between requests 5 seconds When I wait for presence of element by `$.unstableElement` for `PT50S` duration retrying 10 times |step | |When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `http://example.com/testing-page` | Executes the provided sub-steps until the HTTP response body contains an element by the specified JSON path or the maximum number of retries is reached.

Then content type of response body $comparisonRule `$contentType` $comparisonRule - String validation rule. $contentType – Expected content type, e.g. text/html, application/xml, application/json. Example 31. Submit a GET request and check that response body type is application/json When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then content type of response body is equal to `application/json` Validates that the HTTP response does not contain a body. Then response does not contain body Example 32. Submit a POST request and check that response body is absent When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then response does not contain body Compare size of decompressed HTTP response body with the specified expected size in bytes. Then size of decompressed response body is $comparisonRule `$sizeInBytes` $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $sizeInBytes - The expected size of the response body in bytes. Example 33. Submit a GET request and check that response body size is greater or equal to 1200 bytes When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Then size of decompressed response body is greater than or equal to `1200` Saves specified archive entries into varaibles. When I save content of `$archiveData` archive entries to variables:$parameters $archiveData - The archive data to verify. $parameters - The ExampleTable that contains specified string comparison path, variableName, scopes, outputFormat. Available columns: path - The path to the archive entry. variable - The name of variable to save the data. scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. outputFormat - Defines output format of the entry, either TEXT or BASE64. Example 34. Save archive entries When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com/get-zip-archive` When I save content of `${response-as-bytes}` archive entries to variables: |path |variableName|scopes |outputFormat| |txtFileFromZipArchive.txt|text |SCENARIO|TEXT | |txtFileFromZipArchive.txt|base64 |SCENARIO|BASE64 | Then `${text}` is = `Response text from ZIP archive` Then `${base64}` is = `UmVzcG9uc2UgdGV4dCBmcm9tIFpJUCBhcmNoaXZl` Verifies that at least one (or no one) entry in an archive matches the specified string comparison rule. If comparison rule column does not exist, the verification that archive entries have the specified names is performed. Then `$archiveData` archive contains entries with names:$parameters $archiveData - The archive data to verify. $parameters - The ExampleTable that contains specified string comparison rule and entry name pattern that should be found using current rule. Available columns: rule - The string comparison rule. name - Desired entry name pattern used with current rule. Entry name in archive is not always the same as file name. Entry name reflects the full relative path from archive root. Example 35. Submit a GET request and check that response archive has file with extension 'data' in 'data' folder but don’t contain any data file with name 'restrictedData' When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com/get-zip-archive` Then `${response-as-bytes}` archive contains entries with names: |rule |name | |matches |data/.+\\.data | |does not contain |restrictedData.data | Example 36. Submit a GET request and check that response archive has file with name responseTextFromZipArchive.txt When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com/get-zip-archive` Then `${response-as-bytes}` archive contains entries with names: |name | |responseTextFromZipArchive.txt | Validates the defined HTTP resources Actions performed by step: executes HTTP HEAD request against the passed URL if the status code is 200 then the check is considered as passed if the status code falls under any of 404, 405, 501, 503 then the HTTP GET request will be sent if the GET status code is 200 then check is considered as passed, otherwise failed if the target URL had beed already checked then the check is considered as skipped Then HTTP resources are valid:$resources resources - The URLs of HTTP resources to validate Example 37. Verify HTTP resources Then HTTP resources are valid: |url | |https://saucelabs.com | |https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/img/vividus.png| Saves cookie to scope variable. If present several cookies with the same name will be saved cookie with the root path value (path is '/'). When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `$cookieName` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of cookie. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of variable. Example 38. Get cookie with name cookieName and save its value to scenario variable value When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue` When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value` Then '${value}' is equal to 'cookieValue' Change cookie value. If several cookies with the same name exist in cookie store, the value will be changed for all of them. When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `$cookieName` to `$newCookieValue` $cookieName - The name of cookie. $newCookieValue - The new value for $cookieName. Example 39. Get cookie with name cookieName and set new value for it newCookieValue When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue` When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `cookieName` to `newCookieValue` When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value` Then '${value}' is equal to 'newCookieValue' The step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0.

The step is still available via vividus-plugin-rest-api, but it’ll be required to install vividus-plugin-json explicitly starting from VIVIDUS 0.6.0. In order to validate the body of the latest HTTP response use the response dynamic variable to access the body data in conjunction with any step responsible for data validation like data comparison, JSON, XML and other steps. Example 44. Validate response body When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then JSON element from `${response}` by JSON path `$.slideshow` is equal to ` { \"author\": \"Yours Truly\", \"date\": \"date of publication\", \"slides\": [ { \"title\": \"Wake up to WonderWidgets!\", \"type\": \"all\" }, { \"items\": [ \"Why WonderWidgets are great\", \"Who buys WonderWidgets\" ], \"title\": \"Overview\", \"type\": \"all\" } ], \"title\": \"Sample Slide Show\" } ` The HTTP response body can be saved into static variable by using the init variable step in conjunction with the response dynamic variable, it might be useful if you want to preserve the data for further computations since each subsequent HTTP call rewrites previously received response data. Example 45. Save response body into variable When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` When I initialize the scenario variable `json` with value `${response}`","title":"REST API Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-rest-api","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-rest-api.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":3},{"text":"removeWrappingDoubleQuotes","hash":"_removewrappingdoublequotes","id":4},{"text":"encodeUriXyz","hash":"_encodeurixyz","id":5},{"text":"Dynamic variables","hash":"_dynamic_variables","id":6},{"text":"HTTP response as text","hash":"_http_response_as_text","id":7},{"text":"HTTP response as binary data","hash":"_http_response_as_binary_data","id":8},{"text":"HTTP response code","hash":"_http_response_code","id":9},{"text":"Table Transformers","hash":"_table_transformers","id":10},{"text":"FROM_JSON","hash":"_from_json","id":11},{"text":"HTTP Steps","hash":"_http_steps","id":12},{"text":"Set HTTP request configuration","hash":"_set_http_request_configuration","id":13},{"text":"Set HTTP request body","hash":"_set_http_request_body","id":14},{"text":"Prepare multipart HTTP request","hash":"_prepare_multipart_http_request","id":15},{"text":"Set form data HTTP request","hash":"_set_form_data_http_request","id":16},{"text":"Add HTTP headers to the request","hash":"_add_http_headers_to_the_request","id":17},{"text":"Execute HTTP request with absolute URL","hash":"_execute_http_request_with_absolute_url","id":18},{"text":"Execute HTTP request with relative URL","hash":"_execute_http_request_with_relative_url","id":19},{"text":"Compare HTTP response body against resource","hash":"_compare_http_response_body_against_resource","id":20},{"text":"Validate HTTP response code","hash":"_validate_http_response_code","id":21},{"text":"Validate HTTP response time","hash":"_validate_http_response_time","id":22},{"text":"Valdate number of HTTP response headers","hash":"_valdate_number_of_http_response_headers","id":23},{"text":"Validate HTTP response header value","hash":"_validate_http_response_header_value","id":24},{"text":"Validate HTTP response header elements","hash":"_validate_http_response_header_elements","id":25},{"text":"Save HTTP response header value","hash":"_save_http_response_header_value","id":26},{"text":"Validate connection security","hash":"_validate_connection_security","id":27},{"text":"Wait for JSON element in the HTTP response","hash":"_wait_for_json_element_in_the_http_response","id":28},{"text":"Wait for JSON element in the HTTP response with polling interval","hash":"_wait_for_json_element_in_the_http_response_with_polling_interval","id":29},{"text":"Validate secure protocols supported by server","hash":"_validate_secure_protocols_supported_by_server","id":30},{"text":"Wait for expected HTTP status code in response","hash":"_wait_for_expected_http_status_code_in_response","id":31},{"text":"Validate content type of response body","hash":"_validate_content_type_of_response_body","id":32},{"text":"Validate absence of reponse body","hash":"_validate_absence_of_reponse_body","id":33},{"text":"Validate size of response body","hash":"_validate_size_of_response_body","id":34},{"text":"Save ZIP archive entries","hash":"_save_zip_archive_entries","id":35},{"text":"Validate ZIP archive","hash":"_validate_zip_archive","id":36},{"text":"Validate HTTP resources","hash":"_validate_http_resources","id":37},{"text":"HTTP cookie steps","hash":"_http_cookie_steps","id":38},{"text":"Save value of HTTP cookie","hash":"_save_value_of_http_cookie","id":39},{"text":"Change value of all HTTP cookies","hash":"_change_value_of_all_http_cookies","id":40},{"text":"JSON Steps","hash":"_json_steps","id":41},{"text":"Verify context contains data","hash":"_verify_context_contains_data","id":42},{"text":"Verify JSON contains data","hash":"_verify_json_contains_data","id":43},{"text":"Verify number of elements in context","hash":"_verify_number_of_elements_in_context","id":44},{"text":"Verify number of elements in JSON","hash":"_verify_number_of_elements_in_json","id":45},{"text":"Save element from context","hash":"_save_element_from_context","id":46},{"text":"Save element from JSON","hash":"_save_element_from_json","id":47},{"text":"Save number of elements in context","hash":"_save_number_of_elements_in_context","id":48},{"text":"Save number of elements from JSON","hash":"_save_number_of_elements_from_json","id":49},{"text":"Tips & Tricks","hash":"_tips_tricks","id":50},{"text":"Validate HTTP response body","hash":"_validate_http_response_body","id":51},{"text":"Save HTTP response body into variable","hash":"_save_http_response_body_into_variable","id":52}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"The plugin provides integration with continuous testing cloud SauceLabs.

The plugin has the following actions: `ESTABLISH`, `COMPARE_AGAINST` and `CHECK_INEQUALITY_AGAINST` Creates a baseline image. Steps to establish baseline: Run step When I ESTABLISH baseline with name `name` Open report Save image using contextual mouse click → Save as into folder for baselines Compares actual appearance of the page or element against the baseline. Make sure that the baseline you compare against actually exists. Steps to compare baseline: Run step When I COMPARE_AGAINST baseline with name `name` Open report Review comparison results If you need to accept the new baseline: a) Switch to checkpoint view b) Contextual click on the checkpoint image → save as to baseline folder Work the same way as COMPARE_AGAINST except it checks if actual appearance differs from the baseline.

Only visible elements will be found INVISIBLE xpath(//a):i Only invisible elements will be found all xpath(//a):a Either visible and invisible elements will be found The filters are applied after elements search using one of the locators specified above. The elements not matching the filter condition are sorted out without any notice. Filter type Description Example index Get an element by the specified index from a collection of elements found by a locator. Indexes start from 1. tagName(div)→filter.index(2) textPart Filter elements by their text parts. tagName(h3)→filter.textPart(Welcome) state element State id(v1)→filter.state(VISIBLE) caseSensitiveText element text should match case sensitively id(v1)→filter.caseSensitiveText(text) classAttributePart class attribute should contain part id(v1)→filter.classAttributePart(clazz) linkUrl href attribute of the link element id(v1)→filter.linkUrl(/url) linkUrlPart part of href attribute of the link element id(v1)→filter.linkUrlPart(/url) tooltip title attribute value id(v1)→filter.tooltip(title) imageSrcPart src attribute should contain value id(v1)→filter.imageSrcPart(part) placeholder Placeholder attribute should be equal to a value id(v1)→filter.placeholder(placeholder-value) validationIconSource CSS property background-image should match id(v1)→filter.validationIconSource(src) fieldText field text should match expected value id(v1)→filter.fieldText(value) fieldTextPart field text should contain expected value id(v1)→filter.fieldTextPart(value) dropDownText any of select options should be equal to a value id(v1)→filter.dropDownText(value) The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description selenium.grid.platform-name Valid target platform name empty Identifies the operating system for the testing. e.g. Windows selenium.grid.platform-version Valid target platform version empty Identifies the operating system version for the testing. e.g. 10 web-application.session-scope story scenario story The test lifecycle of the browser: the browser opens at the first step requiring browser interaction the browser closes after story or scenario depending on the property value each scenario-level examples table iteration is treated as a separate scenario An empty property value will lead to the error: \"Application session scope is not set\". ui.publish-source-on-failure true false true Whether to publish the application source code on failure or not ui.context.self-healing true false false If the value is set to true, an attempt to reset context will be performed when it becomes stale. selenium.grid.host hostname Remote grid host to be used to create a new session selenium.grid.username username Remote grid username to be used to create a new session selenium.grid.password password Password to be used to create a new session ui.wait.timeout ISO-8601 format PT1M Total duration to wait for UI condition ui.wait.polling-period ISO-8601 format PT2S Used together with ui.wait.timeout.

Here is an example how to configure third-party cookies behaviour. Example 6. Add the following property to allow all cookies web.driver.CHROME.experimental-options={\"prefs\": {\"profile\": {\"cookie_controls_mode\": 0}}} The allowed values for the preference from the example are: 0 - allow all cookies; 1 - block third-party cookies; 2 - block third-party cookies in Incognito mode only. @proxy - some steps require proxy to be turned on: it can be done by setting the corresponding properties or by switching on this meta tag at story level. The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access height and width of the browser window. Variable name Description browser-window-height the height of the browser window browser-window-width the width of the browser window Example 7. Check the dimension of the browser window When I change window size to `800x600` Then `${browser-window-width}` is = `800` Then `${browser-window-height}` is = `600` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 8. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 9. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Profiles allow to choose or parameterize browser that tests run on. See more details on the profiles and nesting strategy on the configuration page. Web-application plugin contains significant number of built-in profiles. They can be found after plugin installation by the following path in Eclipse IDE: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-web-app-X.Y.Z -> properties -> profile -> web Let’s go through the structure and review its content. General place for web profiles. Each of the directory contains browser related properties. This is a place for adjustments for your browser. Add there any properties you need: screen resolution, path to driver or to a custom browser. While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to use custom browser driver. This approach first requires manually downloading the driver (See Quick Reference Section for download links). The path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..driver-executable-path=/path/to/driver/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox safari iexplore edge opera While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to configure path to browser executable file. In general cases it’s not required, installed browsers are found automatically (except Opera browser). Also, for example, if browser is not installed, but only downloaded and unpacked into some folder, the path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..binary-path=/path/to/custom/browser/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox edge opera Profile Example of properties web/desktop/chrome selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments=--disable-auto-reload web/desktop/edge web/desktop/edge/chromium profile is deprecated in favor of web/desktop/edge and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0.

Such feature is reflected in mobile_emulation subdirectory in Profiles. Use device-name property to mention target device: web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.device-name=DEVICE_NAME Available for emulation devices you can find in the Dimensions list in chrome. Custom devices In case you need to use Responsive Viewport Mode and set up your own device, update the screen resolution in the following properties: web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.width=1440 web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.height=900 The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 10. Run chrome in docker container confgiguraiton.profiles=web/docker,web/desktop/chrome Headless mode is a functionality that allows the execution of a full version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display, meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The atomic actions performed are: find the element by the locator; click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is occurred at any atomic action. When I click on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 11. Click on element When I click on element located by `name(Submit)` The step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0. The replacement is Click on element. The replacement pattern is: When I click on element located by `` Clicks on an element found by the locator. When I click on element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 12. Click on element When I click on element located `name(Submit)` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 13. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view. When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 14. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located `id(way_down_button)` into view Opens a new browser tab and switches the focus for future commands to this tab. When I open new tab Example 15. Open page in a new tab When I open new tab Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL. The key difference of this step from the previous one openning a new tab is that this step inherits the state of the previous page, i.e.: new tab will have acces to the session storage of the previous tab, it will be possible to handle alerts appearing on tab closing. When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open. Example 16. Open docs in a new tab When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new window Closes the current tab and switches to the previous tab. When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current tab with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open. Example 17. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new window When I close the current window Trying to close the current tab with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current tab was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new window. If you confirm window close in alert, the tab will be closed, and you will need to switch to current tab using the following step: When I switch to window with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 18. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new window When I click on element located by `xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Table 1. Possible actions type argument Argument example DOUBLE_CLICK Element locator or empty By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Element locator or empty By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text to type Minsk City CLICK Element locator or empty By.caseSensitiveText(Done) PRESS_KEYS Press and release any of Keys BACK_SPACE KEY_DOWN Press any of Keys one by one CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Release any of Keys one by one CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Element locator By.id(username) Example 19. Execute various web-actions When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | This step can be used to perform clipboard interactions. Example 20. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on Windows When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, CONTROL| Example 21. Paste text from the clipboard to the focused field on MacOS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |COMMAND, v| |KEY_UP |v, COMMAND| This set of steps allows to validate the browser console logging messages. In order to configure availability of the INFO level messages use following properties: Browser Property to enable INFO logs Google Chrome selenium.capabilities.goog\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Microsoft Edge Chromium selenium.capabilities.ms\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Validates the absence of log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. Example 22. Validate absence of JS errors Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/' Then there are no browser console ERRORS Validates the absence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels by regex '$pattern' $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $pattern - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 23. Validate absence of JS error referencing user Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/' Then there are no browser console ERRORS by regex '.*user.*' Validates the presence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are browser console $logLevels by regex '$pattern' $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $pattern - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 24. Validate presence of JS errors referencing user Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/' Then there are browser console ERRORS by regex '.*user.*' Waits for the appearance of the console log entries with the expected level and which match regular expression and saves all the entries (including awaited ones) of the expected level gathered during the wait to the scoped variable. Wait uses generic UI timeouts specified by the properties ui.wait.timeout and ui.wait.polling-period. See Properties section for more details. When I wait until browser console $logEntries by regex `$regex` appear and save all entries into $scopes variable `$variableName` $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $pattern - The regular expression to match log entry messages. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the value of the barcode. Example 25. Wait for application readiness Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/' When I wait until browser console infos by regex `.*Application ready.*` appear and save all entries into scenario variable `logs` Then `${logs}` matches `.*Application ready in \\d+ seconds.*` Executes the steps against all elements found by locator. After a required number of elements is found, search context switches in order for each found element and performs all steps on it. If comparison rule mismatch steps will not be performed even if elements are found. When I find $comparisonRule `$number` elements by `$locator` and for each element do$stepsToExecute Alias: When I find $comparisonRule '$number' elements by $locator and for each element do$stepsToExecute $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The number of elements to find. $locator - The locator used to find elements. $stepsToExecute - The ExamplesTable with a single column containing the steps to execute. Example 26. Script type check When I find = `5` elements by `By.xpath(//script):a` and for each element do |step | |When I set 'type' attribute value of the context element to the 'scenario' variable 'type'| |Then `${type}` is equal to `text/javascript` | Waits for the windows with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until window with title that $comparisonRule `$windowTitile` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a window in ISO-8601 format. $comparisonRule - The window title comparison rule. $windowTitle - The expected window title. Example 27. Wait for window and switch to it Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/windows.html' When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until window with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Stops page loading When I stop page loading Could be useful in combination with Selenium’s page load strategy Example 28. Stop page loading.story When I open URL `https://delayed.vividus.dev` in new window When I stop page loading Sets a custom page load timeout for a part of the story When I set page load timeout to `$duration` $duration - total duration to wait for page load completion in ISO-8601 format Example 29. Before loading a heavy page set an increased timeout Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com/' When I set page load timeout to `PT20S` When I open URL `https://example.com/super-heavy-page` in new window When I set page load timeout to `PT10S` Checks web performance metrics. Then metric $webPerformanceMetric is $comparisonRule `$duration` $webPerformanceMetric - The web performance metric. Where: TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE - The time between the navigation start and the response start. DNS_LOOKUP_TIME - The time between the domain lookup start and the domain lookup end. DOM_CONTENT_LOAD_TIME - The time between the DOM loading and the the DOM complete. PAGE_LOAD_TIME - The time between the navgation start and the load event end. $comparisonRule - The duration comparison rule. $duration - The duration to compare against in ISO-8601 format. Example 30. Check page load Given I am on a page with the URL 'https://example.com' Then metric PAGE_LOAD_TIME is less than `PT5S` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element by located `$locator` appears Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 31. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 32. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 33. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 34. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 35. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 36. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 37. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 38. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located `By.id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located `By.id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 39. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 40. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 41. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 42. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located `By.xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Validates the element located by the locator has existed for the period specified by the duration. The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration.

The replacement is a generic step waiting for element disappearance. Waits for an element with the specified tag, attribute type and value disappearance. Actions performed by step: Searches for an element with the specified attribute and tag within search context If there are no elements by specified attribute and tag, step provides passed assertion and don’t check disappearance of an element If there are elements by specified attribute and tag, waits until this element becomes not visible If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). When I wait until an element with the tag '$elementTag' and attribute '$attributeType'='$attributeValue' disappears $elementTag - Type of the html tag (e.g. div or iframe). $attributeType - Type of the tag attribute (e.g. name or id). $attributeValue - Value of the attribute. Example 90. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the div element with a certain attribute and value When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' When I wait until an element with the tag 'div' and attribute 'id'='delayed' disappears Waits for element disappearance with desired timeout. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). Then element located by `$locator` disappears in `$timeout` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): Then element located '$locator' disappears in '$timeout' $locator - The locator used to element. $timeout - The maximum time to wait for the element disappearance in ISO-8601 format. Example 91. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the element for 3 seconds When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' Then element located

It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. Learn more. You can run VIVIDUS automated scenarios on mobile devices using Appium tool. Since Appium has a Client/Server Architecture, it is required to install and run Appium server to perform mobile tests. There are two ways of installing Appium server: Application installation (Appium Desktop) Appium Desktop is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any platform. It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server, so you don’t need to worry about Node. Download the latest version of Appium Desktop. Command line installation Appium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed from source or installed directly from NPM: npm install -g appium To run Appium use the command: appium Make sure you have installed: Java Android SDK Xcode (iOS) And the following environment variables are set: JAVA_HOME ANDROID_HOME You can open \"Edit configuration\" to set the variables in Appium Desktop. Read more details for basic Android and iOS setup in Appium Guide. Appium-Doctor diagnoses, reports and fixes common Node, iOS and Android configuration issues before starting Appium. It helps to make sure you have everything to start using Appium. Appium-doctor checks for: Android: Android sdk exists and configured properly; Environment variables and path check; iOS: XCode is installed (with command line tools); Dev tools security check; Auth check; Node binary check; Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and values that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that tell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required capabilities for any Appium driver should include: platformName: the name of the platform to automate platformVersion: the version of the platform to automate deviceName: the kind of device to automate app: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the browserName capability instead in the case of automating a web browser) automationName: the name of the driver you wish to use There are lots of other capabilities. To find out more please see Appium Capabilities Doc. Before running VIVIDUS scenarios it is necessary to pass Desired Capabilities to Appium Server. Use them as properties with selenium.grid.capabilities. prefix. Then just put these capabilities into the appropriate *.properties file. Please see examples below: Example 1. iOS properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=15.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.ipa Example 2. Android properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=11.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=Pixel 6 selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=UIAutomator2 selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.apk While Android devices require only one additional property, for iOS you need to set three more. See the relevant sections for defining these properties for iOS and Android Appium Inspector is basically just an Appium client with a user interface. It allows to interact with application elements and Appium commands in a user friendly way. You can get the latest version of Inspector application following the link. Click to view capabilities set up in Inspector VIVIDUS Sample Tests is a GitHub repository. Its puropose is to demo VIVIDUS capabilities via sample tests. Let’s use it as an example for running mobile tests via Appium. Assumptions You have installed and properly set up the following: IDE Appium Server AVD Manager (Android) Simulator application (iOS) Cloning and importing the repository Clone vividus-sample-tests project using the following command: git clone --recursive git@github.com:vividus-framework/vividus-sample-tests.git Then use this detailed guide to proceed with importing and building the project. Overriding properties Since we are only interested in the mobile application story, add the following properties to the overriding.properties file. Choose one of the platforms and make sure properties match with your simulator set up. Click to expand overriding.properties Example 3. Minimum iOS setup selenium.grid.capabilities.appiumVersion=1.20.2 selenium.grid.url=http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub configuration.profiles=mobile_app/ios configuration.suites=mobile_app/ios configuration.environments= selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest Example 4.

Click to view screenshots Appium-Desktop Appium in the terminal Tests execution and expected results Execute the test either via ./gradlew runStories command or by clicking the Run button in the IDE. In case everything has been set up correctly you will see the following: Appium creates a new session; Testing application (Swag Labs Mobile) is installed on the simulator; Application is started; Credentials are entered into username and password fields; After successful login user sees the landing page; Executing tests on real devices has some features and required different preparations depending on the platform. Firstly, make sure you have installed Android Debug Bridge. Simply enter in the command line adb --version. You should get some adb information in the output: adb --version Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 Version 31.0.3-7562133 Installed as /usr/local/bin/adb Connect the device you want to interact with to your workstation. Use adb devices command to see the list of connected devices: adb devices List of devices attached UKjeCe9Mr9 device In this example UKjeCe9Mr9 is the unique identifier of the device. Use that number as a udid capability (property) in VIVIDUS: selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=UKjeCe9Mr9 You are ready to run tests! Just add this property to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Emulators Automating a real device with XCUITest Driver(iOS) is considerably more complicated, due to Apple’s restrictions around running apps on real devices. XCUITest driver installs a helper application called WebDriverAgent-Runner onto the device, and handles the application under test via it. While this is simple in theory, the hoops of code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can make this a bit of a headache. There are two approaches for WebDriverAgent configuration: Automatic WDA configuration. Proper work of the WDA requires signing it with a valid Apple Developer account. If you have a paid Apple Developer account, please see the following instructions on Appium Doc; Manual WDA configuration. Using a \"Free\" developer account often leads to issues with the impossibility of creating a wildcard provisioning profile for the default application bundle. Follow the instructions below to handle this issue. The next steps are based on Appium manual configuration doc.

For the first time, Appium will install the WDA application on the Apple device. Since WDA is signed with an unknown Apple Developer account, we need to add it to the trust. Start the session either via Appium Inspector or by running an autotest. Once the WDA icon appears on the screen, do the following: Go to Settings→General→Profile & Device Management (iOS 15 and higher - Settings→General→VPN & Device Management); Tap on \"Apple Development: \"account name\"; Choose \"Trust\"; Click to view screenshot You are ready to run tests! Just add properties from above to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Simulators Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Make sure adb sees the device (adb devices). In case the device is not on the list, try restarting adb server via terminal: adb kill-server && \\ adb start-server WDA is expired. This is the most common issue that appeared on iOS devices Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65 When it happens, the icon of the WebDriverAgent disappears from the device menu. To get it back on the device you should rebuild WDA for your device and add your developer account to trust again; Use this guide to fix WDA expiration much faster Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Yes. You can create the second application signed with your Apple Developer account. Once WebDriverAgent get expired, it will be deleted. But your second app will remain on the device and keep your Apple Developer account in the trusted list. You will only need to rebuild WDA in a click to get it back. Click to expand steps Make sure your device is connected to your workstation; Open Xcode and create a new project; Choose Application type \"App\" for your platform; Enter Product Name, let’s say \"keeper\"; Use the same Team and Organization Identifier that you used for WebDriverAgent; Click Build; Now your mobile device has the keeper application installed. It will remain on the device even when WDA is deleted due to expiration. When it happens, just connect the device, open the WDA project and click build. After the build is successful you can start your Appium sessions again. Make sure your computer and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-FI network.; On Apple TV go to Settings→Remotes and Devices→Remote App and Devices; On your Mac open Xcode→Window→Devices and Simulators (⌘+2); Click \" + \" on the tab \"Devices\" to add a new device.; Choose your Apple TV from the list; Enter the 6-digit passcode that appeared on the TV screen;","title":"Appium Setup","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"appium-setup","url":"/vividus/latest/user-guides/appium-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Intro","hash":"_intro","id":1},{"text":"Install Appium server","hash":"_install_appium_server","id":2},{"text":"Environment setup","hash":"_environment_setup","id":3},{"text":"Appium-Doctor (Optional)","hash":"_appium_doctor_optional","id":4},{"text":"Appium Capabilities","hash":"_appium_capabilities","id":5},{"text":"Setting capabilities in VIVIDUS","hash":"_setting_capabilities_in_vividus","id":6},{"text":"Basic properties","hash":"_basic_properties","id":7},{"text":"Real devices properties","hash":"_real_devices_properties","id":8},{"text":"Appium Inspector (Optional)","hash":"_appium_inspector_optional","id":9},{"text":"Running tests on Simulator/Emulator","hash":"_running_tests_on_simulatoremulator","id":10},{"text":"Running tests on Real Devices","hash":"_running_tests_on_real_devices","id":11},{"text":"Android","hash":"_android","id":12},{"text":"Android device UDID","hash":"_android_device_udid","id":13},{"text":"iOS","hash":"_ios","id":14},{"text":"WDA configuration","hash":"_wda_configuration","id":15},{"text":"Manual WDA configuration","hash":"_manual_wda_configuration","id":16},{"text":"Define properties for running a real apple device","hash":"_define_properties_for_running_a_real_apple_device","id":17},{"text":"First start","hash":"_first_start","id":18},{"text":"F.A.Q.","hash":"_f_a_q","id":19},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an Android device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_android_device","id":20},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an iOS device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_ios_device","id":21},{"text":"It’s quite unhandy to add an Apple Developer account to trusted every time WDA is expired.

Whichever method of database initialization is chosen, RUNSCRIPT statement with the path to SQL files could be used. Here you can specify absolute path to file or use the 'classpath:/' prefix - files will be searched from 'src/main/resources' folder relatively. The details on executing SQL statements on connection could be found in the official H2 guide. 2.1 Configure using INIT property using INIT property data loaded into the database once and can no longer be change.
