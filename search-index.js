Synonyms: examples table, data table. ExamplesTable represents a tabular structure that holds rows of example data for parameters named via the column headers: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| Rows starting with an ignorable separator (defaults to |--) are allowed and ignored: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |-- A commented row --| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |-- Another commented row --| |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The separators are also configurable via inlined properties: {ignorableSeparator=!--,headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!} !header 1!header 2! .... !header n! !-- A commented row --! !value 11!value 12! .... !value 1n! ... !-- Another commented row --! !value m1!value m2! .... !value mn! Comments in column values are supported via the commentSeparator inlined property: {commentSeparator=#} | header 1#comment | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11#comment | value 12 | .... | value 1n | Comments including the separator are stripped. By default all column values are trimmed. To avoid trimming the values, use the trim inlined property: {trim=false} | header 1 | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11 | value 12 | .... | value 1n | By default, all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However, it might be required to map certain values to null-s. This can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| Line break is a default separator for rows in ExamplesTable, that’s why they can’t be added as is to the data. In order to put value with line breaks to ExamplesTable escape sequences (a character preceded by a backslash \\ is an escape sequence) must be used. Escape Sequence Description \\n all leading and trailing argument spaces are trimmed Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x, y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression( x , y , z )} argument 1: x argument 2: y argument 3: z #{expression( x , )} argument 1: x argument 2: meaningful commas (not used as delimiters) can be added to arguments in 2 ways: escape comma using backslash \\ Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x\\,a, y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x \\, a , y\\,b , )} argument 1: x , a argument 2: y,b argument 3: wrap argument into triple quotes (it might be convenient when arguments are get dynamically (e.g. from HTTP response) and escaping of such values could be a bit complicated) The leading and trailing spaces outside triple quotes are trimmed, but the leading and trailing spaces inside triple quotes are preserved. Expression Resulting arguments #{expression( \"\"\"x,a\"\"\" , y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x , \"\"\" y\\,b \"\"\")} Escaping of commas in triple quotes is not allowed, all data is used as argument value. argument 1: x argument 2: y\\,b #{expression( x , \"\"\"\"\"\")} argument 1: x argument 2: Synonyms: project resource, test resource. A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExamplesTable transformer. ExamplesTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\.

There are a few steps to achieve this: Configure link pattern via properties. Example 1. Configure link to issue tracking system in environment.properties system.allure.link.issue.pattern=https://vividus.dev/issues/{} Add meta tags to the story/scenario meta. Example 2. Story level meta-tag containing ID of the issue Meta: @issueId VVD-1 Scenario: Should check variables equals Then `1` is = `1` Run tests and explore the links in the report.

Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued. The following properties are used to configure batches (VIVIDUS doesn’t provide any default batch configuration out of the box). batch-number is one-based batch index. The properties marked with bold are mandatory. Property Default value Description batch-.resource-location The test project path to the folder with story-files batch-.resource-include-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be included in the batch. Leading and trailing whitespaces in patterns are omitted. batch-.resource-exclude-patterns The comma-separated set of ant-patterns to match the stories to be excluded from the batch.

Overrides value specified via story.execution-timeout. batch.fail-fast false If set to true the subsequent batches execution will be stopped after first failed assertion story.fail-fast false If set to true the story execution will be stopped after first failed assertion scenario.fail-fast false If set to true the scenario execution will be stopped after first failed assertion story.execution-timeout PT3H The max duration of the single story in ISO-8601 Durations format. Could be overriden via corresponging batch setting. bdd.configuration.dry-run false Enables dry-run execution mode (no actual steps will be executed, dynamic variables and expressions won’t be resolved). For example dry-run could be useful to debug what stroies will be executed with provided config. bdd.configuration.skip-story-if-given-story-failed false Skips the story in case of failure in the given story bdd.configuration.formats JSON,XML Available formats of the output files with test execution results statistics.print-failures false If set to true prints table of failures including: story, scenario, step and error message report.text-length-diff-threshold 100 Defines text threshold length to enable unified diff report publishing on failure, for variable comparisons. If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. engine.composite-paths Paths to the composite steps e.g. steps/*.steps A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question \"What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?\". These specifics (properties) should be written in the profile.properties file. Path to this file is set in configuration.properties file: Example 2. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=web It’s allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones. Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into profile.properties files in appropriate places. Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution. Let’s create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let’s see profiles structure for this case: └─ src/main/resources/properties └─ profile (1) ├─ web (2) ├─ chrome (4) └─ profile.properties (6) ├─ firefox (4) └─ profile.properties └─ profile.properties (5) ├─ mobile_app (2) ├─ iOS (7) └─ profile.properties ├─ android (7) └─ profile.properties (9) └─ profile.properties (8) └─ profile.properties (3) 1 Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties; 2 General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device; 3 The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device; 4 Web browsers' profiles (directories); 5 Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles; 6 Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices; 7 Mobile profiles (directories); 8 Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only; 9 Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup; By default, profile property is pointed to the /src/main/resources/properties/profile directory, so use the relative path starting from profile when you have nested directories: Example 3. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android Some of the plugins, like web-app, have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers. Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration. Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into environment.properties file. The path to this file is set in configuration.properties file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them: Example 4. configuration.properties configuration.environments=dev #configuration.environments=test #configuration.environments=prod Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the same approach of reusing and separating values. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 5. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 6. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @severity 1 @layout desktop Given I am on page with URL `https://www.epam.com/` Then the page title is equal to 'EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting' Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @severity 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/` Then the page title is equal to 'Google' The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 7. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 8. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 9. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 10. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @severity Numeric values (range 1-5) Used to mark importance of the test where, most usually, the smallest number is the most important Test, the highest number is the least important. @severity 1 @layout desktop, phone, phone_portrait, phone_landscape, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet, tablet_landscape, tablet_portrait Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 11. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 12. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests. GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues. AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all. RED 3 Test report isn’t generated. Common errors: \"InvalidConfigurationException: No batches with tests to execute are configured\" - the configured suite has 0 batches, i.e. no tests to execute are configured. RED Here one could find description of general HTTP properties applied across all the HTTP interactions in VIVIDUS. Property Name Acceptable values Default Description General http.circular-redirects-allowed boolean false Allow circular redirects (redirects to the same location) http.connection-request-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the client connections pool. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.connect-timeout integer 30000 The timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.max-total-connections integer 80 The number of maximum total connections for the client connections pool http.max-connections-per-route integer 60 The number of maximum connections per route for the client connections pool http.socket-timeout integer 3000 The timeout in milliseconds used for waiting for data or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. A negative value is interpreted as undefined (system default if applicable) http.cookie-spec default, ignoreCookies, standard-strict, standard, netscape default The name of the cookie specification to be used for HTTP state management Authentication http.auth.username character sequence The username, presence of this property requires the http.auth.password to be also set http.auth.password character sequence The password, presence of this property requires the http.auth.username to be also set http.auth.preemptive-auth-enabled boolean false If enabled the HTTP client will send the basic authentication data even before the service gives an unauthorized response (401), useful when the service doesn’t support unauthorized response (401) or to reduce the overhead of making the connection SSL handshake http.ssl.check-certificate boolean true Verify certificates sent by the server during SSL handshake, the most common errors occured during verfication are Expired SSL Certificate Error, SSL Certificate Not Trusted Error, SSL Certificate Revoked Error etc. http.ssl.verify-hostname boolean true Verify if the domain name in the SSL certificate matches the domain name in URL where the request is sent to Two-Way SSL authentication http.key-store.type Keystore type JKS The keystore type http.key-store.path Resource The keystore to load http.key-store.password string The password used to unlock the keystore and for the integrity checking http.ssl.private-key-password string The password for the private key DNS resolver http.local-dns-storage. key-value mapping The property prefix used to override the OS DNS lookup by specifying hostname to IP address mappings e.g. http.local-dns-storage.coursera.org=52.84.197.20 Service unavailability retry handler http.service-unavailable-retry.max-retries integer 1 The maximum number of allowed retries if the server responds with a HTTP code specified in http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes property http.service-unavailable-retry.status-codes set of integers The set of HTTP status codes to be retried. If it’s empty, no retries will be performed http.service-unavailable-retry.retry-interval ISO-8601 Durations format PT1S The retry interval between subsequent requests Idempotent retry handler http.idempotent-methods-sending-request-body set of integers The list of HTTP methods containing request body which should be treated as idempotent for retries Most common use cases for externalized configuration are tests parametrization with properties passed from CI/CD pipeline, passing of secrets into test run etc. The available approaches are listed below. Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value variables.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.variables.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.variables.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. Generate the overriding.properties file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project. The following script assumes that we are in the root of the test project folder. cat > src/main/resources/overriding.properties ` in field located by `id(username)` When I enter `` in field located by `id(password)` When I click on element located by `id(signInButton)` Configure paths to files with custom steps: Example 17. Composite steps paths configuration engine.composite-paths=steps/ui/*.steps Use your step in the story: Example 18. Composite step usage example Scenario: Verify login Given I am on main application page When I login with username `admin` and password `pa$$w0rd` Users are allowed to use composite steps in composite step definition. VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let’s take the following step: Example 19. VIVIDUS step When I hover mouse over element located `$locator` Create a new JSON file (for example, aliases/aliases.json) and put the following content with one or more aliases: Example 20. aliases/aliases.json [ { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse over element located `$locator`\", \"aliases\": [ { \"name\": \"When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `$locator`\" }, { \"name\": \"When I hover mouse pointer over web element located `$locator`\" } ] } ] Point the alias configuration property to an exact location or location pattern with the JSON files containing aliases: engine.alias-paths=aliases/aliases.json Use the defined alias in place of actual step in your story When I place mouse pointer over web element located by `id(loginButton)`","title":"Tests Configuration","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"tests-configuration","url":"/vividus/latest/tests-configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"configuration.properties","hash":"_configuration_properties","id":1},{"text":"Suites","hash":"_suites","id":2},{"text":"Profiles","hash":"_profiles","id":3},{"text":"Profiles setup","hash":"_profiles_setup","id":4},{"text":"Built-in profiles","hash":"_built_in_profiles","id":5},{"text":"Environments","hash":"_environments","id":6},{"text":"Known Issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":7},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":8},{"text":"Known Issues file","hash":"_known_issues_file","id":9},{"text":"Examples","hash":"_examples","id":10},{"text":"Meta tags","hash":"_meta_tags","id":11},{"text":"Levels","hash":"_levels","id":12},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties_2","id":13},{"text":"Limitations","hash":"_limitations","id":14},{"text":"1D tags (@key)","hash":"_1d_tags_key","id":15},{"text":"2D tags (@key  value)","hash":"_2d_tags_key_value","id":16},{"text":"Story Prioritization","hash":"_story_prioritization","id":17},{"text":"Exit codes","hash":"_exit_codes","id":18},{"text":"HTTP Configuration","hash":"_http_configuration","id":19},{"text":"Externalized Configuration","hash":"_externalized_configuration","id":20},{"text":"Sensitive Data Encryption","hash":"_sensitive_data_encryption","id":21},{"text":"How to encrypt a string","hash":"_how_to_encrypt_a_string","id":22},{"text":"Option 1 (Recommended): using Jasypt CLI","hash":"_option_1_recommended_using_jasypt_cli","id":23},{"text":"Option 2: using Jasypt Online","hash":"_option_2_using_jasypt_online","id":24},{"text":"How to use an encrypted string in VIVIDUS","hash":"_how_to_use_an_encrypted_string_in_vividus","id":25},{"text":"Composite steps","hash":"_composite_steps","id":26},{"text":"How to use composite steps","hash":"_how_to_use_composite_steps","id":27},{"text":"Steps aliases","hash":"_steps_aliases","id":28},{"text":"How to use steps aliases","hash":"_how_to_use_steps_aliases","id":29}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"In scope of this article the task term is a piece of work that is done on stories, scenarios, steps and other entities and that produces some output based on the work done.

Zelda.character Captain Zelda.game Phantom Hourglass Let’s see the structure of the expression for the following example: #{generate(Internet.password '5', '10', 'true')} #{generate (1) (Internet (2) .password (3) '5', (4) '10', (4) 'true')} (4) 1 Generate expression itself. 2 Data provider from the list. In this case - Internet. Click on its name to see the methods it contains. 3 One of the available methods within Internet data provider - password. There are multiple choices, we picked the fourth one. 4 Available parameters for the chosen method. There are three of them: int minimumLength - minimum number of symbols; int maximumLength - maximum number of symbols; boolean includeUppercase - true or false for Uppercase usage; In this way we created an expression that generates a password from 5 to 10 characters length including uppercase letters. Possible output is 51gVj5aLZY Replaces ? symbols with latin letters. #{generate(letterify '$input', '$isUpperCase')} $input - any string containing ? symbols to be replaced with letters $isUpperCase - boolean, set it to true for uppercase option Table 1. letterify examples Expression Result #{generate(letterify 'test????test')} testnjmytest #{generate(letterify 'test????test', 'true')} testXQBMtest Replaces # symbols with numbers. #{generate(numerify '$input')} $input - any string containing # symbols to be replaced with numbers Table 2. numerify example Expression Result #{generate(numerify 'test####test')} test5862test Combination of letterify and numerify. #{generate(bothify '$input')} $input - any string containing # and ? symbols to be replaced with numbers and letters accordingly Table 3. bothify example Expression Result #{generate(bothify 'test#?#?#?#test')} test2o7v0g9test Replaces symbol mentioned in the second argument with one of the symbols mentioned after it. #{generate(templatify '$input', '$whatToReplace', '$replacement1', '$replacement2', '$replacement3')} $input - any string to process $whatToReplace - part of the string to be replaced $replacement - replacement to use. Possible to use multiple options Table 4. templatify example Expression Result #{generate(templatify 'VIVIDUS', 'I', 'X', 'P')}` VPVPDUS VXVPDUS VPVXDUS VXVXDUS Replaces symbols by example: uppercase with uppercase, digit with digit, lowercase with lowercase. #{generate(examplify '$input')} $input - any string to process Table 5. examplify example Expression Result #{generate(examplify 'V1V1DUs')} R9Q7VTq Allows generating output based on regular expression. #{generate(regexify '$regularExpression')} $regularExpression - regular expression that describes desired output Table 6. regexify example Expression Result #{generate(regexify '\\d{3}\\w{1}')} 409Y #{generate(regexify '[A-Z]{3}[a-z]{4}[2-8]{5}')} PQUlxdq66436 Returns any of provided items. #{generate(options.option '$item1', '$item2', '$item3')} $item - option to choose from Table 7. options example Expression Result #{generate(options.option 'V','I','V','I','D','U','S')} S Generates JSON based on key-value pairs input. #{generate(json '$key1', '$value1', '$key2', '$value2')} Table 8. generate JSON example Expression Result #{generate(json 'first_name','Bob','last_name','Dylan','profession','singer')} {\"first_name\": \"Bob\", \"last_name\": \"Dylan\", \"profession\": \"singer\"} Generates comma-separated values based on input. #{generate(csv, '$rowsNumber' '$columnName1', '$value1', '$columnName2', '$value2')} $rowsNumber - number of rows to fill in $columnName1 - name of the first column $value1 - data to enter the first column $columnName2 - name of the second column $value2 - data to enter the second column Table 9. generate CSV example Expression Result #{generate(csv '3', 'first_name','Bob','last_name','Dylan')} \"first_name\",\"last_name\" \"Bob\",\"Dylan\" \"Bob\",\"Dylan\" \"Bob\",\"Dylan\" Generates a random integer value between the specified origin (minInclusive) and the specified bound (maxInclusive). #{randomInt($minInclusive, $maxInclusive)} $minInclusive - the least value $maxInclusive - the upper bound Table 10.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story.

Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `${login-endpoint}` Then the response code is equal to '200' It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 5. Declaring global variable with expression random-user variables.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 6. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `/authenticate` Then the response code is equal to '200' Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, batch-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 7. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario Given I initialize scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` Given I initialize story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario. Reference to uninitialized variable can be resolved to default value using the operator : (colon). Table 1. Examples of using default values Reference to resolve Variable value Output ${var:default} value value ${var:default} default ${var:} ${var:default:with:colons} default:with:colons ${var[0]:default} default ${var[0].key:default} default ${var:#{generate(DungeonsAndDragons.alignments)}} Chaotic Evil ${var:${var1}} var - , var1 - value value ${var:${var1:}} var - , var1 - Example 8.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

Invoke AWS Lambda function by providing the function name and the payload to pass to the Lambda function. When I invoke AWS Lambda function `$functionName` with payload `$payload` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $functionName - The name of AWS Lambda function, version, or alias. The value can be retrieved by looking at the function in the AWS Console. Supported name formats: Function name: my-function (name-only), my-function:v1 (with alias). Function ARN: arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function. Partial ARN: 123456789012:function:my-function. It’s allowed to append a version number or alias to any of the formats.

Upload data to Amazon S3 When I upload data `{\"my\":\"json\"}` with key `folder/name.json` and content type `application/json` to S3 bucket `testBucket` Retrieve the object by key from the provided S3 bucket and save its content to a variable. The specified bucket and object key must exist, or an error will result. When I fetch object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $objectKey - the key under which the desired object is stored $bucketName - the name of the bucket containing the desired object $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - the variable name Example 3. Download S3 object When I fetch object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `my-json-var` Set the canned access control list (ACL) for the specified object in Amazon S3. Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy. When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error. When I set ACL `$cannedAcl` for object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` $cannedAcl - The new pre-configured canned ACL for the specified object. (See the official documentation for a complete list of the available ACLs) $objectKey - The key of the object within the specified bucket whose ACL is being set. $bucketName - The name of the bucket containing the object whose ACL is being set Example 4. Set public READ permission When I set ACL `public-read` for object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` Collects a list of the S3 objects keys in the specified bucket.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for Java, which defines how a client may access a database. Every JDBC requires using specific driver. JDBC drivers are client-side adapters (installed on the client machine, not on the server) that convert requests from Java programs to a protocol that the database management system (DBMS) can understand. Copy the below line code to dependencies section of the project build.gradle file Example 1. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.5.5-SNAPSHOT') Define your JDBC driver and add appropriate dependency. Let’s take PostgreSQL as an example: Open JDBC page on maven repository; Find driver for your database and open details (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver); Choose and open version (42.5.3); Go to the Gradle tab and copy implementation string; Paste chosen dependency into your build.gradle file: Example 2. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.5.3') In case Maven repository does not contain driver you need, please refer to the documentation of your database to define suitable JDBC driver. If the project was imported to the IDE before adding new plugin, re-generate the configuration files for the used IDE and then refresh the project in the used IDE. For database interaction, you will need to set related properties. They have db.connection. prefix followed by the database connection name (vividus in the example). Come up with your own database name to use within the tests. Put properties into the environment.properties file: Example 3. environment.properties db.connection.vividus.url=jdbc:dbms://databaseUrl:port/databaseName?parameter1=true¶meter2=value (1) db.connection.vividus.username= (2) db.connection.vividus.password= (2) db.connection.vividus.driver-class-name=(3) 1 Database address. Consists of: jdbc: - reference to JDBC; dbms: - Database Management System, e.g. postgresql; //databaseUrl - address to your database; :port - port number, e.g. 5432; /databaseName - name of your database; parameters - any additional driver parameters you need to pass; URL structure slightly changes depending on the database management system. You can find templates for different DBMS in setup examples. 2 Credentials for given database connection; 3 Driver class name (Optional), e.g. org.postgresql.Driver. You might need it to specify the driver name for the exact database. Here are some examples of setting different databases connection for most popular DBMS-s.

Verify clipboard content Then `${clipboard-text}` is equal to `uarlouski@gmail.com` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 9. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 10. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Given I start mobile application Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides globally-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilities have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 11. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 12. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 13. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 14. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Runs mobile application in the background for specific period of time and either activates the app after a certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated (when PT-1S is used). See Appium docs for more details. When I send mobile application to background for `$period` period $period - The period of time in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 15. Run app in background When I send mobile application to background for `PT5S` period Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(login-button)` is equal to `1` Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The settings to set. Example 16.

When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 17. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image Upload the file with data to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file with name `$fileName` and data `$data` to device $data - The data to store as a file. $fileName - The name of the uploaded file. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 18. Upload the file with the image data to the device When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vividus-framework/vividus/master/vividus-tests/src/main/resources/baselines/context.png` When I upload file with name `context.png` and data `${response-as-bytes}` to device Then image is displayed in gallery Example 19. Upload the file with the text data to the device When I upload file with name `message.txt` and data `This is a message` to device Then message file is displayed in file explorer Deletes a file from the device/emulator/simulator. When I delete file `$filePath` from device Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to delete a file or a folder from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type is 'documents'. If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a file inside an application bundle /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle Example 20. Delete file When I delete file `/sdcard/Pictures/avatar.png` from device On iOS real device to add or delete photo or video to/from \"Camera Roll\" you need upload/delete photos or videos to/from /DCIM/100APPLE/ folder and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. Restart device is necessary after that. On iOS simulator to delete photo or video from \"Camera Roll\" you need to delete photo or video from /Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. And then restart simulator.

It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 43. Perform profiling during application usage When I start recording `Time Profiler` metrics !-- set of actions to measure performance When I stop recording `Time Profiler` metrics and save results to file `${outputDirectory}/time_profiler.zip` Sets the slider value in percents. The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypeSlider. The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively. When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypeSlider element. $percent - The target value of the slider in percents. Example 44. Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `90` percents Example 45. Set value of iOS slider (with range -50:50) to 20 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `70` percents Example 46. Set value of iOS slider (with range 18:65) to 55 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range. The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations. The target element must be of type android.widget.SeekBar. The number must be greater than or equal to 0. Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure. When I set value of Android slider located `$locator` to `$number` $locator - The locator to find android.widget.SeekBar element. $number - The number to set on the slider Example 47. Set value of Android slider (with range 0:50) to 13 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `13` Example 48. Set value of Android slider (with range -50:50) to -25 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `25` Example 49. Set value of Android slider (with range 18:65) to 20 When I set value of Android slider located `xpath(//android.widget.SeekBar)` to `2` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element by located `$locator` appears Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 50. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 51. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 52. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 53. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 54. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 55. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 56. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 57. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located `By.id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 58. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located by `$locator` in scope of current context Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 59. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 60. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 61. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Validates the element located by the locator has existed for the period specified by the duration. The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration. Then element located by `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): Then element located `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - The Locator to find an element. $duration - The period of time the element should have existed in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 62. The element should have existed for 5 second Then element located by `id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Example 63. Navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `1` When I navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `0` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order. The collection should have more than 1 element with not empty text, otherwise the step fails. Example 64. Deprecated syntax Then elements located $locator are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order Then elements located by $locator are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order $locator - Locator. $sortingOrder Plain Readable Description ASCENDING ascending Verify that elements are sorted in ascending order DESCENDING descending Verify that elements are sorted in descending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_ASCENDING case-insensitive ascending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive ascending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_DESCENDING case-insensitive descending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive descending order Example 65.

In order to validate the body of the latest HTTP response use the response dynamic variable to access the body data in conjunction with any step responsible for data validation like data comparison, JSON, XML and other steps. Example 41. Validate response body When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then JSON element from `${response}` by JSON path `$.slideshow` is equal to ` { \"author\": \"Yours Truly\", \"date\": \"date of publication\", \"slides\": [ { \"title\": \"Wake up to WonderWidgets!\", \"type\": \"all\" }, { \"items\": [ \"Why WonderWidgets are great\", \"Who buys WonderWidgets\" ], \"title\": \"Overview\", \"type\": \"all\" } ], \"title\": \"Sample Slide Show\" } ` The HTTP response body can be saved into static variable by using the init variable step in conjunction with the response dynamic variable, it might be useful if you want to preserve the data for further computations since each subsequent HTTP call rewrites previously received response data. Example 42. Save response body into variable When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Given I initialize scenario variable `json` with value `${response}`","title":"REST API Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-rest-api","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-rest-api.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":3},{"text":"removeWrappingDoubleQuotes","hash":"_removewrappingdoublequotes","id":4},{"text":"encodeUriXyz","hash":"_encodeurixyz","id":5},{"text":"Dynamic variables","hash":"_dynamic_variables","id":6},{"text":"HTTP response as text","hash":"_http_response_as_text","id":7},{"text":"HTTP response as binary data","hash":"_http_response_as_binary_data","id":8},{"text":"HTTP response code","hash":"_http_response_code","id":9},{"text":"Table Transformers","hash":"_table_transformers","id":10},{"text":"FROM_JSON","hash":"_from_json","id":11},{"text":"HTTP Steps","hash":"_http_steps","id":12},{"text":"Set HTTP request configuration","hash":"_set_http_request_configuration","id":13},{"text":"Set HTTP request body","hash":"_set_http_request_body","id":14},{"text":"Prepare multipart HTTP request","hash":"_prepare_multipart_http_request","id":15},{"text":"Set form data HTTP request","hash":"_set_form_data_http_request","id":16},{"text":"Add HTTP headers to the request","hash":"_add_http_headers_to_the_request","id":17},{"text":"Execute HTTP request with absolute URL","hash":"_execute_http_request_with_absolute_url","id":18},{"text":"Execute HTTP request with relative URL","hash":"_execute_http_request_with_relative_url","id":19},{"text":"Compare HTTP response body against resource","hash":"_compare_http_response_body_against_resource","id":20},{"text":"Validate HTTP response code","hash":"_validate_http_response_code","id":21},{"text":"Validate HTTP response time","hash":"_validate_http_response_time","id":22},{"text":"Valdate number of HTTP response headers","hash":"_valdate_number_of_http_response_headers","id":23},{"text":"Validate HTTP response header value","hash":"_validate_http_response_header_value","id":24},{"text":"Validate HTTP response header elements","hash":"_validate_http_response_header_elements","id":25},{"text":"Save HTTP response header value","hash":"_save_http_response_header_value","id":26},{"text":"Validate connection security","hash":"_validate_connection_security","id":27},{"text":"Wait for JSON element in the HTTP response","hash":"_wait_for_json_element_in_the_http_response","id":28},{"text":"Wait for JSON element in the HTTP response with polling interval","hash":"_wait_for_json_element_in_the_http_response_with_polling_interval","id":29},{"text":"Validate secure protocols supported by server","hash":"_validate_secure_protocols_supported_by_server","id":30},{"text":"Wait for expected HTTP status code in response","hash":"_wait_for_expected_http_status_code_in_response","id":31},{"text":"Validate content type of response body","hash":"_validate_content_type_of_response_body","id":32},{"text":"Validate absence of response body","hash":"_validate_absence_of_response_body","id":33},{"text":"Validate size of response body","hash":"_validate_size_of_response_body","id":34},{"text":"Save ZIP archive entries","hash":"_save_zip_archive_entries","id":35},{"text":"Validate ZIP archive","hash":"_validate_zip_archive","id":36},{"text":"Validate HTTP resources","hash":"_validate_http_resources","id":37},{"text":"HTTP cookie steps","hash":"_http_cookie_steps","id":38},{"text":"Save value of HTTP cookie","hash":"_save_value_of_http_cookie","id":39},{"text":"Change value of all HTTP cookies","hash":"_change_value_of_all_http_cookies","id":40},{"text":"JSON Steps","hash":"_json_steps","id":41},{"text":"Verify context contains data","hash":"_verify_context_contains_data","id":42},{"text":"Verify JSON contains data","hash":"_verify_json_contains_data","id":43},{"text":"Verify number of elements in context","hash":"_verify_number_of_elements_in_context","id":44},{"text":"Verify number of elements in JSON","hash":"_verify_number_of_elements_in_json","id":45},{"text":"Save element from context","hash":"_save_element_from_context","id":46},{"text":"Save element from JSON","hash":"_save_element_from_json","id":47},{"text":"Save number of elements in context","hash":"_save_number_of_elements_in_context","id":48},{"text":"Save number of elements from JSON","hash":"_save_number_of_elements_from_json","id":49},{"text":"Tips & Tricks","hash":"_tips_tricks","id":50},{"text":"Validate HTTP response body","hash":"_validate_http_response_body","id":51},{"text":"Save HTTP response body into variable","hash":"_save_http_response_body_into_variable","id":52}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"The plugin provides integration with continuous testing cloud SauceLabs.

The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 9. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 10. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Profiles allow to choose or parameterize browser that tests run on. See more details on the profiles and nesting strategy on the configuration page. Web-application plugin contains significant number of built-in profiles. They can be found after plugin installation by the following path in Eclipse IDE: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-web-app-X.Y.Z -> properties -> profile -> web Let’s go through the structure and review its content. General place for web profiles. Each of the directory contains browser related properties. This is a place for adjustments for your browser. Add there any properties you need: screen resolution, path to driver or to a custom browser. While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to use custom browser driver. This approach first requires manually downloading the driver (See Quick Reference Section for download links). The path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..driver-executable-path=/path/to/driver/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox safari iexplore edge opera While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to configure path to browser executable file. In general cases it’s not required, installed browsers are found automatically (except Opera browser). Also, for example, if browser is not installed, but only downloaded and unpacked into some folder, the path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..binary-path=/path/to/custom/browser/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox edge opera Profile Example of properties web/desktop/chrome selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments=--disable-auto-reload web/desktop/edge web/desktop/edge/chromium profile is deprecated in favor of web/desktop/edge and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0.

Such feature is reflected in mobile_emulation subdirectory in Profiles. Use device-name property to mention target device: web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.device-name=DEVICE_NAME Available for emulation devices you can find in the Dimensions list in chrome. Custom devices In case you need to use Responsive Viewport Mode and set up your own device, update the screen resolution in the following properties: web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.width=1440 web.driver.CHROME.mobile-emulation.height=900 The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 11. Run chrome in docker container confgiguraiton.profiles=web/docker,web/desktop/chrome Headless mode is a functionality that allows the execution of a full version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display, meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Main page can be set by the property web-application.main-page-url in the property file. Given I am on main application page Example 12. Open page defined in the web-application.main-page-url variable Given I am on main application page Loading the page with a given absolute URL, e.g. https://example.com/. Given I am on page with URL `$pageURL` Example 13. Open 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Navigates the browser to the specific path in the current host defined in the relative URL step parameter. A relative URL can point to a file within a web site (like about.html or /products). If the parameter starts with '/' char, navigation will be performed from the root of the host, see examples below. If the parameter starts without '/' char or with './', navigation will be performed from the current path directory. Table 2. Examples Current page Relative URL parameter Opened page https://mysite.com about.html https://mysite.com/about.html https://mysite.com /products/new https://mysite.com/products/new https://mysite.com/path/foo stats https://mysite.com/path/foo/stats https://mysite.com/path/foo ./docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo/docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo /documents https://mysite.com/documents When I go to relative URL `$relativeURL` relativeURL - A string value of the relative URL. Open main application page and then navigate to '/products/new' page on the application host Given I am on main application page When I go to relative URL `/products/new` Clicks on the element found by the specified locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the element by the locator; click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is occurred at any atomic action. If element by the specified locator is not clickable (overlapped by another element, problems with page/context loading or the element is disabled) the step will fail with corresponding error: Could not click on the element: org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted: Element Where to Buy is not clickable at point (1619, 275). Other element would receive the click: ... When I click on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 14. Click on element When I click on element located by `name(Submit)` The step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0. The replacement is Click on element. The replacement pattern is: When I click on element located by `` Clicks on an element found by the locator. When I click on element located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 15. Click on element When I click on element located `name(Submit)` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 16. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located by `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view. When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 17. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located `id(way_down_button)` into view Validates that the text is presented in the current context. Expected text is case sensitive. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text `$text` exists $text - Expected text. Example 18. Check the text 'Contract Us' is presented on the page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then text `Contract Us` exists Validates that the text is not presented in the current context. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text `$text` does not exist $text - Text that should not exist. Example 19. Check the text 'Deprecated' is not presented in the element When I change context to element located by `id(code)` Then text `Deprecated` does not exist Opens a new browser tab and switches the focus for future commands to this tab. When I open new tab Example 20. Open page in a new tab When I open new tab Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL. The key difference of this step from the previous one opening a new tab is that this step inherits the state of the previous page, i.e.: new tab will have acces to the session storage of the previous tab, it will be possible to handle alerts appearing on tab closing. When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open. Example 21. Open docs in a new tab When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new window Closes the current tab and switches to the previous tab. When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current tab with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open. Example 22. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new window When I close the current window Trying to close the current tab with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current tab was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new window. If you confirm window close in alert, the tab will be closed, and you will need to switch to current tab using the following step: When I switch to window with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 23. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new window When I click on element located by `xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Table 3. Possible actions type argument Argument example DOUBLE_CLICK Element locator or empty By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Element locator or empty By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text to type Minsk City CLICK Element locator or empty By.caseSensitiveText(Done) PRESS_KEYS Press and release any of Keys BACK_SPACE KEY_DOWN Press any of Keys one by one CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Release any of Keys one by one CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Element locator By.id(username) Example 24. Execute various web-actions When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | This step can be used to perform clipboard interactions. Example 25. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on Windows When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, CONTROL| Example 26. Paste text from the clipboard to the focused field on MacOS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |COMMAND, v| |KEY_UP |v, COMMAND| This set of steps allows to validate the browser console logging messages. In order to configure availability of the INFO level messages use following properties: Browser Property to enable INFO logs Google Chrome selenium.capabilities.goog\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Microsoft Edge Chromium selenium.capabilities.ms\\:loggingPrefs.browser=INFO Validates the absence of log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. Example 27. Validate absence of JS errors Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/` Then there are no browser console ERRORS Validates the absence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are no browser console $logLevels by regex '$pattern' $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $pattern - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 28. Validate absence of JS error referencing user Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/` Then there are no browser console ERRORS by regex '.*user.*' Validates the presence of specific log entries of the desired level in the browser console. Then there are browser console $logLevels by regex '$pattern' $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $pattern - The regular expression to match log entry messages. Example 29. Validate presence of JS errors referencing user Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/` Then there are browser console ERRORS by regex '.*user.*' Waits for the appearance of the console log entries with the expected level and which match regular expression and saves all the entries (including awaited ones) of the expected level gathered during the wait to the scoped variable. Wait uses generic UI timeouts specified by the properties ui.wait.timeout and ui.wait.polling-period. See Properties section for more details. When I wait until browser console $logEntries by regex `$regex` appear and save all entries into $scopes variable `$variableName` $logLevels - List of the comma-separated messages levels. The supported levels are: ERRORS, WARNINGS, INFOS. $pattern - The regular expression to match log entry messages. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the value of the barcode. Example 30. Wait for application readiness Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/` When I wait until browser console infos by regex `.*Application ready.*` appear and save all entries into scenario variable `logs` Then `${logs}` matches `.*Application ready in \\d+ seconds.*` Executes the steps against all elements found by locator. After a required number of elements is found, search context switches in order for each found element and performs all steps on it. If comparison rule mismatch steps will not be performed even if elements are found. When I find $comparisonRule `$number` elements by `$locator` and for each element do$stepsToExecute Alias: When I find $comparisonRule '$number' elements by $locator and for each element do$stepsToExecute $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The number of elements to find. $locator - The locator used to find elements. $stepsToExecute - The ExamplesTable with a single column containing the steps to execute. Example 31. Script type check When I find = `5` elements by `By.xpath(//script):a` and for each element do |step | |When I set 'type' attribute value of the context element to the 'scenario' variable 'type'| |Then `${type}` is equal to `text/javascript` | Waits for the windows with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until window with title that $comparisonRule `$windowTitile` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a window in ISO-8601 Durations format. $comparisonRule - The window title comparison rule. $windowTitle - The expected window title. Example 32. Wait for window and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site.onrender.com/windows.html` When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until window with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Stops page loading When I stop page loading Could be useful in combination with Selenium’s page load strategy Example 33. Stop page loading.story When I open URL `https://delayed.vividus.dev` in new window When I stop page loading Sets a custom page load timeout for a part of the story When I set page load timeout to `$duration` $duration - total duration to wait for page load completion in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 34. Before loading a heavy page set an increased timeout Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I set page load timeout to `PT20S` When I open URL `https://example.com/super-heavy-page` in new window When I set page load timeout to `PT10S` Checks web performance metrics. Then metric $webPerformanceMetric is $comparisonRule `$duration` $webPerformanceMetric - The web performance metric. Where: TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE - The time between the navigation start and the response start. DNS_LOOKUP_TIME - The time between the domain lookup start and the domain lookup end. DOM_CONTENT_LOAD_TIME - The time between the DOM loading and the the DOM complete. PAGE_LOAD_TIME - The time between the navigation start and the load event end. $comparisonRule - The duration comparison rule. $duration - The duration to compare against in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 35. Check page load Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com` Then metric PAGE_LOAD_TIME is less than `PT5S` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element by located `$locator` appears Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): When I wait until element located `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 36. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): When I wait until element located `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 37. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 38. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 39. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 40. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 41. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 42. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Example 43. Save the attribute value of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save `innerText` attribute value of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the element located by locator into a variable. When I save `$attributeName` attribute value of element located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $attributeName - The name of an element attribute. $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the attribute value. Save the attribute value of the element When I save `innerText` attribute value of element located `By.id(username)` to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves number of elements located by locator into a variable. When I save number of elements located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the number of elements. Example 44. Save number of elements When I save number of elements located `tagName(a)` to scenario variable `numberOfLinks` Then `${numberOfLinks}` is equal to `1` Changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located by `$locator` in scope of current context Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` in scope of current context $locator - Locator. Example 45. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `xpath(//body)` in scope of current context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets current context and changes the context to an element located by locator for limiting area of subsequent UI interactions. When I change context to element located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I change context to element located `$locator` $locator - Locator. Example 46. Change context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` Resets the context. When I reset context Example 47. Reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` When I change context to element located by `xpath(//body)` Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `0` When I reset context Then number of elements found by `By.xpath(html)` is equal to `1` Validates the element located by the locator has existed for the period specified by the duration. The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration. Then element located by `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): Then element located `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - The Locator to find an element. $duration - The period of time the element should have existed in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 48. The element should have existed for 5 second Then element located by `id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Example 49. Navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `1` When I navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `0` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order. The collection should have more than 1 element with not empty text, otherwise the step fails. Example 50. Deprecated syntax Then elements located $locator are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order Then elements located by $locator are sorted by text in $sortingOrder order $locator - Locator. $sortingOrder Plain Readable Description ASCENDING ascending Verify that elements are sorted in ascending order DESCENDING descending Verify that elements are sorted in descending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_ASCENDING case-insensitive ascending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive ascending order CASE_INSENSITIVE_DESCENDING case-insensitive descending Verify that elements are sorted in case-insensitive descending order Example 51. Check items are sorted Given I am on page with URL `https://grocery.by` When I click on element located by `id(a-z)` Then elements located by `xpath(//span[@id='item-to-purchase'])` are sorted by text in ascending order Takes a screenshot and publish it to the report. When I take screenshot Takes a screenshot and saves it to the default folder defined by user. The full path to a screenshot will be posted to logs and allure When I take screenshot and save it to folder `$path` $path - The absolute or relative path to the folder to save taken screenshot. Example 52.

If it’s not set - takes a screenshot of the entire page Scans a barcode from the screenshot and save its value to the variable When I scan barcode from context and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the value of the barcode. Example 59. Scan the barcode When I change context to element located by `xpath(//div[@id='qrCode'])` When I scan barcode from context and save result to scenario variable `qrCodeLink` Then `${qrCodeLink}` is equal to `https://www.example.com` Fields are elements where users can enter data. The most typical fields are: input, textarea, CKE editor (it usually should be located via body tag, that is contained in a frame as a separate HTML document). Enters the text in a field found by the specified locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the field by the locator; clear the field if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; type the text in the field; the first three actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is thrown at any atomic action. When I enter `$text` in field located by `$locator` $text - The text to enter in the field. $locator - The locator used to find field. Example 60. Add text 'pa$$w0rd' in password field When I enter `pa$$w0rd` in field located by `id(password)` Enters the text in the field found by the specified locator without clearing of the previous content. When I add `$text` to field located by `$locator` $text - The text to add to the field. $locator - The locator used to find field. Example 61. Add text 'name' to username field When I add `name` to field located by `id(username)` Clears the field found by the specified locator. The step does not trigger any keyboard or mouse events on the field. When I clear field located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find field. Example 62. Clear username field When I clear field located by `id(username)` Clears the field found by the specified locator using keyboard. The step simulates user action by pressing buttons Ctrl+A and then Backspace that allows to trigger keyboard events on the field. When I clear field located by `$locator` using keyboard $locator - The locator used to find field. Example 63. Clear password field using keyboard When I clear field located by `id(password)` using keyboard Validates whether the dropdown located by locator exists and contains the list of the expected options. Then dropdown located `$locator` contains options: $option $locator - The locator used to find dropdown. $options - examples table describing expected options Example 64. Validate dropdown contains a set of colors Then a drop down with the name 'colors' contains the items: |state|item | |false|Red | |false|Green| |true |Blue | The item is an option. The state (true or false) specifies whether the item is selected. Verifies if dropdown located by locator exists and first selected option. Then dropdown located `$locator` exists and selected option is `$option` $locator - The locator used to find dropdown. $option - first selected option Example 65. Dropdown.story Then dropdown located `id(colors)` exists and selected option is `Blue` Selects option in multi-select dropdown Step will fail if target dropdown is not multi-select When I add `$option` to selection in dropdown located `$locator` $option - option to select $locator - The locator used to find dropdown. Example 66. Dropdown.story When I add `Two` to selection in dropdown located `id(numbers)` Selects option in dropdown Does not support multi-selection When I select `$option` in dropdown located `$locator`` $option - option to select $locator - The locator used to find dropdown. Example 67. Dropdown.story When I select `Red` in dropdown located `id(colors)` Validates whether the certain cookie is set. Then cookie with name `$cookieName` is set $cookieName - The name of the cookie to check presence. Example 68. Check the session cookie is present Then cookie with name `JSESSIONID` is set Validates whether the certain cookie is not set. Then cookie with name `$cookieName` is not set $cookieName - The name of the cookie to check absence. Example 69. Check the session cookie is not present Then cookie with name `JSESSIONID` is not set Adds the cookies provided in the input ExamplesTable. It’s allowed to add the cookies for the current domain only: make sure the web browser is opened at the expected domain. The actions performed by the step: add the cookies; refresh the current page (this action is required to apply the changes in cookies). When I set all cookies for current domain:$parameters $parameters - The parameters of the cookies to set as ExamplesTable: Column Name Description cookieName the name of the cookie to set cookieValue the value of the cookie to set path the path of the cookie to set Example 70. Set the cookie for the current domain When I set all cookies for current domain: |cookieName |cookieValue |path | |cookieAgreed |2 |/ | Finds the cookie by the name and saves its value to a variable. When I save value of cookie with name `$cookieName` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of the cookie to save the value. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie value. Example 71. Get the value of the session cookie When I save value of cookie with name `JSESSIONID` to scenario variable `session-id` Finds the cookie by the name and saves all its parameters as JSON to a variable. When I save cookie with name `$cookieName` as JSON to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of the cookie to save. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie. Example 72. Get the session cookie When I save cookie with name `JSESSIONID` as JSON to scenario variable `session-id` Removes the certain cookie from the current domain. The actions performed by the step: remove the certain cookie the from current domain; refresh the current page (this action is required to apply the changes in cookies). When I remove cookie with name `$cookieName` from current domain $cookieName - The name of the cookie to remove. Example 73. Remove the session cookie When I remove cookie with name `JSESSIONID` from current domain Removes the certain cookie from the current domain, but does not apply the changes in cookies. The current page must be refreshed or the navigation must be performed to apply the cookie changes. When I remove cookie with name `$cookieName` from current domain without applying changes $cookieName - The name of the cookie to remove. Example 74. Remove the session cookie When I remove cookie with name `JSESSIONID` from current domain without applying changes When I refresh the page Removes all cookies from the current domain. The actions performed by the step: remove all cookies from the current domain; refresh the current page (this action is required to apply the changes in cookies). When I remove all cookies from current domain Removes all cookies from the current domain, but does not apply the changes in cookies. The current page must be refreshed or the navigation must be performed to apply the cookie changes. When I remove all cookies from current domain without applying changes Finds the web storage item by the key and saves its value to the variable. When I save $storageType storage item with key `$key` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. $key - The name of the key to retrieve the value of. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to store the value of the web storage item. Example 75. Get the value of the local storage item When I save local storage item with key `token` to scenario variable `application-token` Adds the item with the specified key-value pair to the web storage, or updates that key’s value if it already exists. When I set $storageType storage item with key `$key` and value `$value` $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. $key - The name of the key to create/update. $value - The value to give the key that is creating/updating. Example 76. Set the session storage item When I set session storage item with key `token` and value `session-token` Validates the web storage item with the specified key exists. Then $storageType storage item with key `$key` exists $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. $key - The name of the key to check presence. Example 77. Check the session storage item is present Then session storage item with key `token` exists Validates the web storage item with the specified key does not exist. Then $storageType storage item with key `$key` does not exist $storageType - One of the web storage mechanisms: either local or session. $key - The key of the local storage item to check absence. Example 78. Check the local storage item is not present Then local storage item with key `token` does not exist This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The actions preformed by the step: extract HTTP messages from the recorded proxy archive filter out the HTTP messages with the response status code 302 Moved Temporarily find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression check that the total number of the found HTTP messages satisfies the desired condition In case of failure the full HTTP archive (HAR) is attached to the report. Then number of HTTP $httpMethods requests with URL pattern `$urlPattern` is $comparisonRule `$number` $httpMethods - The comma-separated HTTP methods to filter by $urlPattern - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL $comparisonRule - Comparison Rule $number - The number to compare with Example 79. Check the number of HTTP GET and POST requests matching URL regular expression is equal to 1 Then number of HTTP GET, POST requests with URL pattern `http://httpbin\\.org/get` is equal to `1` Save the HTTP message part from the HTTP request with given URL-pattern into the variable with specified name and the scopes. This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The actions preformed by the step: extract HTTP messages from the recorded proxy archive filter out the HTTP messages with the response status code 302 Moved Temporarily find HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and the URL regular expression check that total number of the found HTTP messages is equal to 1 save the HTTP message part to the specified variable In case of failure the full HTTP archive (HAR) is attached to the report. When I capture HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` and save $httpMessagePart to $scopes variable `$variableName` $httpMethods - The \"or\"-separated set of HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. GET or POST or PUT. $urlPattern - The regular expression to match HTTP request URL. $httpMessagePart - The HTTP message part to save. One of: URL - The request URL. URL query - The request URL query parameters. request data - The request data includes the following keys: query - The URL query is stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the query parameter and value is the list of query parameter values. The query parameter values are accessible via zero-based index. requestBody.mimeType - The MIME type of posted data, the variable will not be saved if MIME type is not present. requestBody.text - The posted data as plain text, the variable will not be saved if the request body is not present. requestBodyParameters - The form data parameters are stored as a collection of key and value pairs, where key is the name of the form parameter and value is the list of form parameter values. The form parameter values are accessible via zero-based index. responseStatus - The response status, the variable will not be saved if the response is not present. response data - The response data includes the following keys: responseBody.mimeType - The MIME type of response data, the variable will not be saved if MIME type is not present. responseBody.text - The response data as plain text, the variable will not be saved if the response body is not present. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the HTTP message part. Example 80. Validate the URL of the matching HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET or POST request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL to scenario variable `URL` Then `${URL}` is equal to `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Example 81. Validate the URL query of the matching HTTP request Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL query to scenario variable `query` Then `${query.q[0]}` is equal to `vividus` Then `${query.q}` is equal to `[vividus]` Then `${query}` is equal to `{q=[vividus]}` Example 82. Validate the request data from the matching HTTP message Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` and save request data to scenario variable `data` Then `${data.query}` is equal to `{}` Then `${data.requestBodyParameters}` is equal to `{delivery=, custtel=, comments=, custemail=, custname=}` Then `${data.requestBody}` is not equal to `null` Then `${data.responseStatus}` is equal to `200` Example 83. Validate the response data from the matching HTTP message Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` and save request data to scenario variable `data` Then `${data.responseBody.text}` is equal to `{\"status\": \"ok\"}` Then `${data.responseBody.mimeType}` is equal to `application/json` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Waits for the HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and URL regular expression. If no HTTP request is sent and wait timeout is reached, then the step will fail. When I wait until HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` exists in proxy log $httpMethods - the \"or\"-separated HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. 'GET or POST or PUT' $urlPattern - the regular expression to match HTTP request URL Example 84.

It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The step clears the HTTP requests and responses recorded by the proxy When I clear proxy log Example 86. Clear the data recorded by the proxy Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` When I clear proxy log Then number of HTTP GET requests with URL pattern 'https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus' is equal to `0` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. The step clears previously created mocks When I clear proxy mocks Example 87. Clear the proxy mocks When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which CONTAINS `vividus` using response code `200`, content `#{loadResource(page.html)}` and headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|text/html| When I clear proxy mocks Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Then number of elements found by `id(sw)` is = `0` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Mocks HTTP response by methods with a provided content No actual request will be executed. Short-circuited response will be returned. When I mock HTTP $httpMethods responses with request URL which $comparisonRule `$url` using response code `$responseCode`, content `$payload` and headers:$headers $httpMethods - The \"or\"-separated set of HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. GET or POST or PUT. $rule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $code - The response status code $content - The content to send within a response $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 88. Hijack a page When I mock HTTP POST responses with request URL which CONTAINS `example` using response code `202`, content `#{loadResource(mocked-example.json)}` and headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Mocks HTTP response with a provided content No actual request will be executed. Short-circuited response will be returned. When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which $comparisonRule `$url` using response code `$responseCode`, content `$payload` and headers:$headers $rule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $code - The response status code $content - The content to send within a response $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 89. Hijack a page When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which CONTAINS `example.com` using response code `200`, content `#{loadResourceAsByteArray(page.html)}` and headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|text/html| This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Mocks HTTP response No actual request will be executed. Short-circuited response will be returned. When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which $comparisonRule `$url` using response code `$responseCode` and headers:$headers $rule - String comparison rule $url - The input value of URL to filter by $code - The response status code $headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns \"name\" and \"value\" specifying HTTP header names and values respectively Example 90. 404 page When I mock HTTP responses with request URL which CONTAINS `example.com` using response code `404` and headers: |name |value| |Content-Length|0 | Changes the current browser window size to the specified one. The specified browser window size should be smaller than the current screen resolution. When I change window size to `$targetSize` $targetSize - The desired browser window size in pixels, e.g. 800x600, where the first measure is window width, the last one is window height. Example 91. Resize the browser window Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I change window size to `640x320` Steps allow to interact with video elements. Starts video playback. When I play video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find video player. Pauses video playback. When I pause video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find video player. Rewinds video to the desired mark in seconds. When I rewind time to `$number` seconds in video player located `$locator` $number - time mark in seconds $locator - The locator used to find video player. Saves video player info: duration, currentTime, src, networkState. For more information about the properties see HTML Audio/Video Properties When I save info from video player located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find video player. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the info. If the variable name is info, the following variables will be created: ${info.src}- The current source of the audio/video element ${info.duration} - The length of the current audio/video (in seconds) ${info.currentTime} - The current playback position in the audio/video(in seconds) ${info.networkState} - The current network state of the audio/video. For more information see: Network State Example 92. Video player verifications Given I am on page with URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqyVpCV-3c` When I pause video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I rewind time to `777` seconds in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I play video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I save info from video player located `cssSelector(video)` to SCENARIO variable `info` Then `${info.currentTime}` is > `0` Then `${info.duration}` is > `1000` Then `${info.networkState}` is = `2` Then `${info.src}` matches `.+youtube.+` Allows to set command line arguments for browsers. This step works similar to the property web.driver..command-line-arguments In case both property and step are used - arguments from property will be ignored. Step will take effect for all new browser sessions created in the current story. It will not affect the current sessions. List of supported command line arguments for popular browsers: . Chrome . Firefox . Internet Explorer Not supported browsers: . Safari . Edge When I set browser command line arguments to `$argsString` $argsString - Sequence of command line arguments, separated by space. Example 93. Set the browser to use the mocked camera stream When I set browser command line arguments to `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream --use-file-for-fake-video-capture=${videoStorage}/${video1}.y4m --use-fake-device-for-media-stream` Given I am on main application page Executes async JavaScript code and saves result into variable. When I execute async javascript `$jsCode` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $jsCode - Any JavaScript code. In order to save a result return statement should be used. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie value. Example 94. Validate response When I execute async javascript ` var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1]; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', '/resource/data.json', true); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState == 4) { callback(xhr.responseText); } }; xhr.send();` and save result to scenario variable `response` Then `${response}` matcher `.+` The step is deprecated and will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0. The replacement is a generic step waiting for element disappearance. Waits for an element with the specified tag, attribute type and value disappearance. Actions performed by step: Searches for an element with the specified attribute and tag within search context If there are no elements by specified attribute and tag, step provides passed assertion and don’t check disappearance of an element If there are elements by specified attribute and tag, waits until this element becomes not visible If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). When I wait until an element with the tag '$elementTag' and attribute '$attributeType'='$attributeValue' disappears $elementTag - Type of the html tag (e.g. div or iframe). $attributeType - Type of the tag attribute (e.g. name or id). $attributeValue - Value of the attribute. Example 95. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the div element with a certain attribute and value When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' When I wait until an element with the tag 'div' and attribute 'id'='delayed' disappears Waits for element disappearance with desired timeout. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). Then element located by `$locator` disappears in `$timeout` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.6.0): Then element located '$locator' disappears in '$timeout' $locator - The locator used to element. $timeout - The maximum time to wait for the element disappearance in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 96. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the element for 3 seconds When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' Then element located 'By.xpath(//div[@id='delayed'])' disappears in 'PT3S'","title":"Web Application

It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. Learn more. You can run VIVIDUS automated scenarios on mobile devices using Appium tool. Since Appium has a Client/Server Architecture, it is required to install and run Appium server to perform mobile tests. There are two ways of installing Appium server: Application installation (Appium Desktop) Appium Desktop is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any platform. It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server, so you don’t need to worry about Node. Download the latest version of Appium Desktop. Command line installation Appium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed from source or installed directly from NPM: npm install -g appium To run Appium use the command: appium Make sure you have installed: Java Android SDK Xcode (iOS) And the following environment variables are set: JAVA_HOME ANDROID_HOME You can open \"Edit configuration\" to set the variables in Appium Desktop. Read more details for basic Android and iOS setup in Appium Guide. Appium-Doctor diagnoses, reports and fixes common Node, iOS and Android configuration issues before starting Appium. It helps to make sure you have everything to start using Appium. Appium-doctor checks for: Android: Android sdk exists and configured properly; Environment variables and path check; iOS: XCode is installed (with command line tools); Dev tools security check; Auth check; Node binary check; Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and values that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that tell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required capabilities for any Appium driver should include: platformName: the name of the platform to automate platformVersion: the version of the platform to automate deviceName: the kind of device to automate app: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the browserName capability instead in the case of automating a web browser) automationName: the name of the driver you wish to use There are lots of other capabilities. To find out more please see Appium Capabilities Doc. Before running VIVIDUS scenarios it is necessary to pass Desired Capabilities to Appium Server. Use them as properties with selenium.grid.capabilities. prefix. Then just put these capabilities into the appropriate *.properties file. Please see examples below: Example 1. iOS properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=15.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.ipa Example 2. Android properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=android selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=11.0 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=Pixel 6 selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=UIAutomator2 selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.apk While Android devices require only one additional property, for iOS you need to set three more. See the relevant sections for defining these properties for iOS and Android Appium Inspector is basically just an Appium client with a user interface. It allows to interact with application elements and Appium commands in a user friendly way. You can get the latest version of Inspector application following the link. Click to view capabilities set up in Inspector VIVIDUS Sample Tests is a GitHub repository. Its purpose is to demo VIVIDUS capabilities via sample tests. Let’s use it as an example for running mobile tests via Appium. Assumptions You have installed and properly set up the following: IDE Appium Server AVD Manager (Android) Simulator application (iOS) Cloning and importing the repository Clone vividus-sample-tests project using the following command: git clone --recursive git@github.com:vividus-framework/vividus-sample-tests.git Then use this detailed guide to proceed with importing and building the project. Overriding properties Since we are only interested in the mobile application story, add the following properties to the overriding.properties file. Choose one of the platforms and make sure properties match with your simulator set up. Click to expand overriding.properties Example 3.

Click to view screenshots Appium-Desktop Appium in the terminal Tests execution and expected results Execute the test either via ./gradlew runStories command or by clicking the Run button in the IDE. In case everything has been set up correctly you will see the following: Appium creates a new session; Testing application (Swag Labs Mobile) is installed on the simulator; Application is started; Credentials are entered into username and password fields; After successful login user sees the landing page; Executing tests on real devices has some features and required different preparations depending on the platform. Firstly, make sure you have installed Android Debug Bridge. Simply enter in the command line adb --version. You should get some adb information in the output: adb --version Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 Version 31.0.3-7562133 Installed as /usr/local/bin/adb Connect the device you want to interact with to your workstation. Use adb devices command to see the list of connected devices: adb devices List of devices attached UKjeCe9Mr9 device In this example UKjeCe9Mr9 is the unique identifier of the device. Use that number as a udid capability (property) in VIVIDUS: selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=UKjeCe9Mr9 You are ready to run tests! Just add this property to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Emulators Automating a real device with XCUITest Driver(iOS) is considerably more complicated, due to Apple’s restrictions around running apps on real devices. XCUITest driver installs a helper application called WebDriverAgent-Runner onto the device, and handles the application under test via it. While this is simple in theory, the hoops of code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can make this a bit of a headache. There are two approaches for WebDriverAgent configuration: Automatic WDA configuration. Proper work of the WDA requires signing it with a valid Apple Developer account. If you have a paid Apple Developer account, please see the following instructions on Appium Doc; Manual WDA configuration. Using a \"Free\" developer account often leads to issues with the impossibility of creating a wildcard provisioning profile for the default application bundle. Follow the instructions below to handle this issue. The next steps are based on Appium manual configuration doc. Add a new Apple Development Certificate for your Apple ID; Click to see details Open Xcode and go to settings Click \"+\" to add an account and then Sign In with your Apple ID Add a new Apple Development Certificate Build WebDriverAgent signed with your newly created certificate; Open WDA project in Xcode; Most common path to the project: /Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj Come up with your unique Bundle Identifier. Use it for updating build parameters. Click to see details Make sure you’ve chosen correct device and parameters image::appium-check-device-and-parameters.png[] Create your unique BundleId and update build parameters image::appium-update-build-parameters.png[] Build the project Click to see details # iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeSigningId=Apple Development(1) selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=b3f34105281bb345p980p824401d5913f13efe81(2) selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeOrgId=5H8S64Q9G4(3) selenium.grid.capabilities.updatedWDABundleId=yourUniqueBundleId.WebDriverAgentRunner(4) 1 xcodeSigningId For any Apple device use Apple Development as the xcodeSigningId property. 2 UDID Make sure your Apple device is connected; Open Finder and choose your device; Copy udid from the device information; Click to view screenshots 3 xcodeOrgId Open KeyChain Access application; Go to Default Keychains → Login; Open My Certificates tab and find certificated you have created recently; Open Certificate and use Organisational Unit parameter as xcodeOrgId property; Click to view screenshots 4 updatedWDABundleId Use your unique Bundle Identifier that was created previously as updatedWDABundleId property; When all tools are installed and set up and all desired capabilities are defined, we can start our tests. For the first time, Appium will install the WDA application on the Apple device. Since WDA is signed with an unknown Apple Developer account, we need to add it to the trust. Start the session either via Appium Inspector or by running an autotest. Once the WDA icon appears on the screen, do the following: Go to Settings→General→Profile & Device Management (iOS 15 and higher - Settings→General→VPN & Device Management); Tap on \"Apple Development: \"account name\"; Choose \"Trust\"; Click to view screenshot You are ready to run tests! Just add properties from above to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Simulators Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Make sure adb sees the device (adb devices). In case the device is not on the list, try restarting adb server via terminal: adb kill-server && \\ adb start-server WDA is expired. This is the most common issue that appeared on iOS devices Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65 When it happens, the icon of the WebDriverAgent disappears from the device menu. To get it back on the device you should rebuild WDA for your device and add your developer account to trust again; Use this guide to fix WDA expiration much faster Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Yes. You can create the second application signed with your Apple Developer account. Once WebDriverAgent get expired, it will be deleted. But your second app will remain on the device and keep your Apple Developer account in the trusted list. You will only need to rebuild WDA in a click to get it back. Click to expand steps Make sure your device is connected to your workstation; Open Xcode and create a new project; Choose Application type \"App\" for your platform; Enter Product Name, let’s say \"keeper\"; Use the same Team and Organization Identifier that you used for WebDriverAgent; Click Build; Now your mobile device has the keeper application installed.

The database is deployed on tests start, accessible from tests and shutdown on tests end. The test data can be created from SQL files located in the project. Add the required dependencies (DB plugin, H2 database) to the project build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.5.5-SNAPSHOT') implementation(group: 'com.h2database', name: 'h2', version: '2.1.214') Configure connection to the H2 database and initialization DDL/DQL scripts could be run using either INIT property of the connection string or the step executing SQL queries. Whichever method of database initialization is chosen, RUNSCRIPT statement with the path to SQL files could be used. Here you can specify absolute path to file or use the 'classpath:/' prefix - files will be searched from 'src/main/resources' folder relatively. The details on executing SQL statements on connection could be found in the official H2 guide. 2.1 Configure using INIT property using INIT property data loaded into the database once and can no longer be change. Example 1. Configure connection and initialization of the database db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ INIT=create schema if not exists test\\\\;\\ SET SCHEMA test\\\\;\\ DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.students\\\\;\\ CREATE TABLE test.students (firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL)\\\\;\\ INSERT INTO students (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Maria', 'Miller')\\\\; db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= Example 2.

Example 3. Configure connection to database db.connection.testh2db.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test;\\ DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1; db.connection.testh2db.username= db.connection.testh2db.password= If you are using database initialization in the step, do not forget to set the property DB_CLOSE_DELAY.

Execute SQL script against H2 database When I execute SQL query ` SELECT * FROM students ` against `testh2db` and save result to scenario variable `h2-records` Example 7.
