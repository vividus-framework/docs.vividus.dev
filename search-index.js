We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail. He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I’ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I’ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them…​ but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it…​ ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love…​ And it is not an idea that I miss, it is a man…​ A man that made me remember the Fifth of November.

Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in tests, the variable will keep the results of a calculation, step execution, expression evaluation, or any other user-defined data. VIVIDUS provides the following syntax to access variable value: ${variableName} There are 2 types of variables: regular - such variables are initialized and controlled by users; dynamic - these variables are available out of the box and provided by VIVIDUS core and plugins, the values of such variables are calculated at the runtime (i.e. the same variables in different parts of tests may result in different values). Dynamic variables support both lower camel case (e.g. ${dynamicVariableName}) and lower hyphen case (e.g. ${dynamic-variable-name}) name formats. Whenever the variable placeholder is found in tests, VIVIDUS attempts to resolve it using the chain having the following order: regular variables, default value if it’s specified in the variable placeholder, system properties, OS environment variables, dynamic variables (keep in mind, if dynamic variable is available, but couldn’t be resolved due to errors or conditions mismatch, the error message will be logged and variable will be kept unresolved). If the end of chain is reached and the variable is not resolved, the variable placeholder will be kept as is: ${variableName}. Regular variables can have one of the following scopes. The scopes names are case-insensitive. Name Description step The scope is used within nested steps and the variables are invalidated after the nested steps are executed. scenario Variables are available in the rest of the scenario after variable declaration. scenario-scoped variables are invalidated once the scenario is completed. story Variables are available in the rest of the story after variable declaration. story-scoped variables declared inside given stories are available in the parent story. Variables are invalidated once the story is completed. next_batches Variables are available in the next batches. next_batches-scoped variable is not available in batch it’s declared within. batch Such variables are declared only with batch-.variables. prefix and available throughout the execution of the batch in the suite. An attempt to create the batch-scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 1. Declaring batch variable locale batch-1.variables.locale=/us/en/ batch-2.variables.locale=/uk/en/ Example 2. Using batch variable locale Given I am on main application page When I go to the relative URL '${locale}' global Such variables are declared only via properties with variables. prefix and available throughout the entire execution. An attempt to create the globally scoped variables during test execution leads to an error. Example 3. Declaring global variable login-endpoint variables.login-endpoint=https://my-auth-server.com/api/login Example 4. Using global variable login-endpoint Given request body: { \"username\":\"user\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `${login-endpoint}` Then response code is equal to `200` It is possible to reuse repeatable VIVIDUS expressions placeholders via global variables storage mechanism. Please mind that expression will be executed lazily at the runtime and randomizing/generating expressions may produce different results per usage. Example 5. Declaring global variable with expression random-user variables.random-user=#{anyOf(superadmin,admin)} Example 6. Using global variable random-user Given request body: { \"username\":\"${random-user}\", \"password\":\"pass\" } When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `/authenticate` Then response code is equal to `200` Regular variables are resolved using the chain having the following order: step-scoped variables, scenario-scoped variables, story-scoped variables, next_batches-scoped variables, batch-scoped variables, global-scoped variables. If variable is resolved, the resolution process is stopped, it means the narrower-scoped variables may override the wider-scoped variables in narrow scope lifetime. For example: Example 7. Variables override mechanism Scenario: First scenario Given I initialize scenario variable `var` with value `scenario` Given I initialize story variable `var` with value `story` Then `${var}` is equal to `scenario` Scenario: Second scenario Then `${var}` is equal to `story` var variable will be resolved to value scenario at the validation point in the first scenario, but it will be resolved to value story in the second scenario. Reference to uninitialized variable can be resolved to default value using the operator : (colon). Table 1. Examples of using default values Reference to resolve Variable value Output ${var:default} value value ${var:default} default ${var:} ${var:default:with:colons} default:with:colons ${var[0]:default} default ${var[0].key:default} default ${var:#{generate(DungeonsAndDragons.alignments)}} Chaotic Evil ${var:${var1}} var - , var1 - value value ${var:${var1:}} var - , var1 - Example 8.

Values from list variables can be accessed by index. For example, ${listVar[0]} returns the first value. Values from map variables can be accessed by key. For instance, ${mapVar.key} returns the value associated with 'key'. VIVIDUS provides the ability to store tables in variables. Tables should have a header and at least one row with values. Table 2. Assuming we have the table below stored in the variable 'tableVar': A B A1 B1 A2 B2 To access specific cell values, specify the row and header key. Rows indexing starts from 0. * ${tableVar[0].A} returns the value from the first row of column A: A1. * ${tableVar[1].B} returns the value from the second row of column B: B2.","title":"Variables","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"variables","url":"/vividus/latest/commons/variables.html","titles":[{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution","id":1},{"text":"Regular variables","hash":"_regular_variables","id":2},{"text":"Scopes","hash":"_scopes","id":3},{"text":"Resolution","hash":"_resolution_2","id":4},{"text":"Default values","hash":"_default_values","id":5},{"text":"Complex types variables","hash":"_complex_types_variables","id":6},{"text":"Accessing values","hash":"_accessing_values","id":7},{"text":"Working with tables","hash":"_working_with_tables","id":8}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Here one could find description of the steps that are delivered with Vividus itself without any plugins required.

Synonyms: examples table, data table. ExamplesTable represents a tabular structure that holds rows of example data for parameters named via the column headers: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| Rows starting with an ignorable separator (defaults to |--) are allowed and ignored: |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |-- A commented row --| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |-- Another commented row --| |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The separators are also configurable via inlined properties: {ignorableSeparator=!--,headerSeparator=!,valueSeparator=!} !header 1!header 2! .... !header n! !-- A commented row --! !value 11!value 12! .... !value 1n! ... !-- Another commented row --! !value m1!value m2! .... !value mn! Comments in column values are supported via the commentSeparator inlined property: {commentSeparator=#} | header 1#comment | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11#comment | value 12 | .... | value 1n | Comments including the separator are stripped. By default all column values are trimmed. To avoid trimming the values, use the trim inlined property: {trim=false} | header 1 | header 2 | .... | header n | | value 11 | value 12 | .... | value 1n | By default, all empty values in ExamplesTable are treated as empty strings. However, it might be required to map certain values to null-s. This can be done at the step implementation level or by applying the generic approach at the table level: {nullPlaceholder=NULL} |header | |value 1| |NULL | |value 3| Line break is a default separator for rows in ExamplesTable, that’s why they can’t be added as is to the data. In order to put value with line breaks to ExamplesTable escape sequences (a character preceded by a backslash \\ is an escape sequence) must be used. Escape Sequence Description \\n Insert a newline in the value at this point. \\r Insert a carriage return in the text at this point. \\\\ Insert a backslash character in the text at this point. The inlined property processEscapeSequences defines whether escape sequences should be replaced in the data. It’s false by default (no property is declared explicitly). The allowed values are true and false, any other values are considered invalid and will lead to parsing error. {processEscapeSequences=true, commentSeparator=#} |header | |line 1\\nline 2 |# The value with a newline |line 1\\r\\nline 2|# The value with a carriage return and a newline |line 1\\\\nline 2 |# The value with an escaped escape sequence, the result will be \"line 1\\nline 2\" Synonyms: VIVIDUS expression. An expression is a special placeholder which is detected, evaluated and resolved during test execution. Expressions are used for the data generation and transformation. General expression syntax is: #{expression} During resolution process the expression placeholder is replaced with the result of the expression evaluation. If expression is unknown for VIVIDUS, the placeholder will be kept as is. If expression evaluation results in error, it will be propagated to the top level and the test will be marked as broken. Expression accepts 1 or more arguments as input parameters. It’s allowed to construct nested expressions: in this case the evaluation starts with the deepest expression. Expressions may include any number of variables placeholders. Expressions accepting exactly 1 argument process it as is: all leading and trailing spaces are preserved no symbols are changed or removed Expression Resulting argument #{expression(x)} x #{expression( x )} x #{expression( x, y, z )} x, y, z #{expression( x\\, y\\, z )} x\\, y\\, z #{expression(\"\"\" x, y, z \"\"\")} \"\"\" x, y, z \"\"\" The rules used for processing of expressions accepting more than 1 argument are following: comma , is a delimiter for arguments Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x,y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression(x:a,y;b,z)} argument 1: x:a argument 2: y;b argument 3: z #{expression(x,)} argument 1: x argument 2: all leading and trailing argument spaces are trimmed Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x, y)} argument 1: x argument 2: y #{expression( x , y , z )} argument 1: x argument 2: y argument 3: z #{expression( x , )} argument 1: x argument 2: meaningful commas (not used as delimiters) can be added to arguments in 2 ways: escape comma using backslash \\ Expression Resulting arguments #{expression(x\\,a, y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x \\, a , y\\,b , )} argument 1: x , a argument 2: y,b argument 3: wrap argument into triple quotes (it might be convenient when arguments are get dynamically (e.g. from HTTP response) and escaping of such values could be a bit complicated) The leading and trailing spaces outside triple quotes are trimmed, but the leading and trailing spaces inside triple quotes are preserved. Expression Resulting arguments #{expression( \"\"\"x,a\"\"\" , y\\, b)} argument 1: x,a argument 2: y, b #{expression( x , \"\"\" y\\,b \"\"\")} Escaping of commas in triple quotes is not allowed, all data is used as argument value. argument 1: x argument 2: y\\,b #{expression( x , \"\"\"\"\"\")} argument 1: x argument 2: Synonyms: project resource, test resource. A resource is data (text, images, audio, and so on) that tests need to access in a way that is independent of the location of the test source code (either it’s a local tests execution from IDE, or via Gradle, or from test artifact in CI/CD). All resources are located in src/main/resources folder of the test project by default. A resource name is a path relative to this folder, e.g. the resource located at: └─ src └─ main └─ resources └─ data └─ request.json can be referenced in the tests as /data/request.json. The name of a resource is independent of the used operating system; in particular, the path separator is always a slash /. Synonyms: transformer, ExamplesTable transformer. ExamplesTable enables the transformation of its string representation via the \"transformer\" inlined property. It’s allowed to define a chain of transformers, in this case the transformers are applied sequentially from top to bottom: {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER} {transformer=ONE_MORE_MY_TRANSFORMER} |header 1|header 2| .... |header n| |value 11|value 12| .... |value 1n| ... |value m1|value m2| .... |value mn| The special characters , { } must be escaped in the transformer properties using character \\. Example 1. Escaping special characters in transformer properties {transformer=MY_TRANSFORMER, countries=\\{Australia\\,Canada\\}} In the example above the transformer will have a single property with name countries and value {Australia,Canada}. VIVIDUS variables of scopes global and next batches can be used in transformer properties (pay attention to escapes of the variables placeholders in the example below). Example 2.

Properties prefixed with configuration. should be specified in the following locations only: The system properties. The configuration.properties file. The overriding.properties file. The property configuration.suites defines the suites set. It is a comma separated set of suite file addresses: Example 1. configuration.properties configuration.suites=testSuite,anotherDir/anotherTestSuite VIVIDUS suite consists of the unlimited number of batches. In its turn the batch consists of any number of stories represented by the files with *.story extension. The batches are run sequentially, while the stories in the batch are run in parallel. The suites are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence, in other words, the values of the properties defined in the first suite will take precedence over the values of the same properties defined in all subsequent suites. If any of the suites in the sequence is not found (i.e. no *.properties file is present at the given path), the error will be thrown and the execution will be stopped. However if suites property is empty (configuration.suites=) and no suite is configured in the root (i.e no files can be found by /properties/suite/*.properties pattern), no error will be thrown and the execution will be continued.

If you want to have this report despite the size of the compared data set 0. engine.composite-paths Paths to the composite steps e.g. steps/*.steps A profile defines the subject of the test, i.e. it answers the question \"What are specifics of the browser/device I want to run tests on?\". These specifics (properties) should be written in the profile.properties file. Path to this file is set in configuration.properties file: Example 2. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=web It’s allowed to create multiple profiles. This can be useful for cross-browsing or cross-device testing: there is no need of changing all the properties, just switch the profile. As well as the suites, profiles are loaded one by one starting from the last one in the sequence. This allows to reuse common properties and separate specific ones. Define the number of profiles you need to set up. In case of multiple profiles, distinguish common and specific properties and put them into profile.properties files in appropriate places. Please keep in mind that running multiple profiles (e.g. for Chrome and Firefox simultaneously) is not supported. All the properties would be merged, but not iterated as separate profiles for scenario execution. Let’s create an example. Imagine that our project contains automated scenarios for a couple of platforms: web and mobile. We will need to run autotests on different browsers and different devices. Therefore some of the properties would be common, but many of them should only belong to a certain subject. Let’s see profiles structure for this case: └─ src/main/resources/properties └─ profile (1) ├─ web (2) ├─ chrome (4) └─ profile.properties (6) ├─ firefox (4) └─ profile.properties └─ profile.properties (5) ├─ mobile_app (2) ├─ iOS (7) └─ profile.properties ├─ android (7) └─ profile.properties (9) └─ profile.properties (8) └─ profile.properties (3) 1 Profile directory which contains all the profiles properties; 2 General type of the profiles, either a browser or a mobile device; 3 The highest level of profile properties. Values written in this file will be applied to any browser or device; 4 Web browsers' profiles (directories); 5 Web-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for any web browser, but not for mobiles; 6 Chrome-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect any other browsers or mobile devices; 7 Mobile profiles (directories); 8 Mobile-oriented properties. Values from this file will be applied for iOS and Android devices only; 9 Android-specific profile. Any properties written here will not affect iOS devices or any browser setup; By default, profile property is pointed to the /src/main/resources/properties/profile directory, so use the relative path starting from profile when you have nested directories: Example 3. configuration.properties configuration.profiles=mobile_app/android Some of the plugins, like web-app, have built-in profiles. You can find them in project explorer after installation by the following path: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-name -> properties -> profile Depending on the stage of the project, you will likely need to run automated scenarios on different environments, such as development, testing, and production servers. Rather than using specific variables in each profile or suite, always updating them according to the currently selected server, and eventually making mistakes, we instead use the environment configuration. Environment configuration allows putting environment-related variables (e.g. host, API endpoint) into environment.properties file. The path to this file is set in configuration.properties file. Create as many property files as a number of environments you have and easily switch between them: Example 4. configuration.properties configuration.environments=dev #configuration.environments=test #configuration.environments=prod Environment variables can also be declared in multiple files. Define common and specific properties for your environments and take the same approach of reusing and separating values. Configuration set simplifies reusage of pre-defined combinations of profiles/suites/environments. Users are allowed to define multiple configuration sets. Only one configuration set can be used during a test run. Example 5. Configuration sets definition configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.profiles= configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.suites=uat configuration-set.api-preprod-uat.environments=preprod configuration-set.api-test-regression.profiles= configuration-set.api-test-regression.suites=regression configuration-set.api-test-regression.environments=test Once configuration sets are defined, one can use an active configuration set for test execution. Example 6. Usage of configuration set configuration-set.active=api-preprod-uat Configuration sets can be defined only in configuration.properties file. Active configuration set overrides defined configuration.profiles, configuration.suites and configuration.environments properties. Configuration set requires to define profiles, suites and environments, empty value considered as a valid one. Known issues mechanism allows to distinguish failures from known issues presented in the system under test. JSON file should contain a valid JSON. If JSON is not valid known issues will be ignored and warning about invalid file will be printed. Property Default value Description known-issue-provider.fileName known-issues.json Defines the location of the known issues file known-issue-provider.detect-potentially-known-issues true Defines are potentially known issues detected The file represents a collection of JSON elements describing known issues. Example 7. known-issues.json { \"VVD-1\": { (1) \"type\": \"Internal\",(2) \"assertionPattern\": \"Expected: a value equal to 200, Actual: \\\\[404\\\\]\", (3) \"storyPattern\": \"Validate the Math\", (4) \"scenarioPattern\": \"Validate equality\", (5) \"stepPattern\": \"Then `1` is = `2`.+\", (6) \"variablePatterns\": { (7) \"var\": \"value-.*\" }, \"failScenarioFast\": true, (8) \"failStoryFast\": true, (9) \"description\": \"Missing endpoint configuration on server side\" (10) } } 1 [Mandatory] Identifier (This could be an ID of the issue in your bug tracking system) 2 [Mandatory] Issue type. One of: INTERNAL (application issue), EXTERNAL (3rd party issue), AUTOMATION (test automation issue) 3 [Mandatory] Assertion pattern describes which failed assertions should be considered as known 4 Story pattern to match the file name of the failed story. Pay attention, the file name extension (.story) should not be included in the pattern, only base file name is matched. 5 Scenario pattern to match failed scenario name 6 Step pattern to match failed step. 7 Variable patterns. Patterns to match variables. 8 Skip the rest of scenario in case of failure identified as this known issue 9 Skip the rest of story in case of failure identified as this known issue 10 Known issue description, it’s used to give the meaningful explanation of the issue if it’s not tracked in bug tracking system or if the issue is too complicated and to improve overall transparency Use \\\\ for escaping of special characters in regular expressions To consider failed assertion known or potentially-known assertionPattern should match assertion failure, if defined variablePatterns should match also. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, to consider issue known all of them should match. If assertionPattern/variablePatterns matched and you have story/scenario/step/Pattern defined, when at least one not matched issue is considered potentially known. Meta tags can be used to reach several goals: Grouping of stories and scenarios in the report. Dynamic selection of tests to execute by meta tags. Management of capabilities for the particular tests. Meta tags may be used at both story and scenario level. Meta tags specified at the story level are propagated to every scenario, if the same meta tag is used at the scenario level, then the scenario level value takes precedence. Example 8. Levels of meta tags !-- Story level Meta: @group Login Scenario: Open Epam main page !-- Scenario level Meta: @priority 1 @layout desktop Given I am on page with URL `https://www.epam.com/` Then page title is equal to `EPAM | Enterprise Software Development, Design & Consulting` Scenario: Open Google main page Meta: @priority 2 @layout desktop @skip Given I am on page with URL `https://www.google.com/` Then page title is equal to `Google` The property bdd.meta-filters is used to filter tests to be executed and relies on Groovy syntax. Example 9. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and matching default filters bdd.meta-filters=group == 'Login' The prorerty bdd.all-meta-filters is used to override values of the default meta filters based on the tags: @skip, @layout etc. Example 10. Execute stoies and scenarios marked with '@group Login' tag and without '@skip' tag bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: (group == 'Login' && !skip) Since meta filters properties are based on Groovy, meta tags names support only normal Groovy identifiers by default. If it’s required to use arbitrary characters in meta tags names (e.g.follow kebab-case notation which actively relies on the hyphen char), then quoted identifiers or subscript operator must be used in the properties. Example 11. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (quoted identifiers approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this.'test-stand' Example 12. Execute stoies and scenarios not marked with '@test-stand' tag (subscript operator approach) bdd.all-meta-filters=groovy: !this['test-stand'] Tag Description @skip Used to exclude particular scenarios from the test execution Tag Key Allowed values Description Example @layout desktop, phone, chrome_phone, chrome_responsive, chrome_tablet, tablet Used to specify layout, using which marked story or scenario should be executed. In case if this meta tag is not specified, default (desktop) value is used for web applications. @layout desktop In order to start stories in particular order it is possible to assign the stories a numeric priority, the stories with the higher priority start first. To enable the feature create a file spring.xml in the src/main/resources directory and add the following XML data into that file. Example 13. Configuration The story_priority value that corresponds to a meta name in stories can be changed to arbitrary value without spaces. Taking story_priority as an example the priority meta should be placed at the story level as the following example shows: Example 14. Prioritized.story Meta: @story_priority 15 Scenario: Time consuming test When I perform highly time consuming task The tests execution returns one of the following exit codes. Code Description Status 0 Test report is generated, contains only passed tests. GREEN 1 Test report is generated, contains only passed and tests with known issues. AMBER 2 Test report is generated, contains any tests except passed and with known issues or doesn’t contain tests at all. RED 3 Test report isn’t generated. Common errors: \"InvalidConfigurationException: No batches with tests to execute are configured\" - the configured suite has 0 batches, i.e. no tests to execute are configured.

Declare an environment variable containing the desired property value and then point the property to the declared environment variable: export EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE=value variables.some-key=${EXTERNAL_CONFIG_VALUE} Pass the property with its value into a test run using command line arguments prepending it with the -Pvividus. prefix. The prefix only plays role during test start-up phase and cut off during the actual test run: ./gradlew runStories -Pvividus.variables.some-key-1=value1 -Pvividus.variables.some-key-2=value2 This approach can be used only when tests are run via Gradle. Generate the overriding.properties file on-the-fly and put it into corresponding folder in a test project.

Composite steps paths configuration engine.composite-paths=steps/ui/*.steps Use your step in the story: Example 17. Composite step usage example Scenario: Verify login Given I am on main application page When I login with username `admin` and password `pa$$w0rd` Users are allowed to use composite steps in composite step definition. VIVIDUS allows to define set of aliases for steps in JSON format and then use them in stories. Select a step you want to create alias for, as an example let’s take the following step: Example 18.

Please make sure that the bdd.configuration.formats property includes JSON value in order to generate test execution results. azure-devops-exporter.organization string The name of the Azure DevOps organization. azure-devops-exporter.project string Project ID or project name. azure-devops-exporter.area string The area of the product which a test case is associated with. If the Area name is inherited from the Project name in AzureDevOps this property should be empty. You can check this by making a request for any Work Item within current Area and checking if the System.AreaPath contains any data besides the Project name. azure-devops-exporter.section-mapping.steps AUTOMATED AUTOMATED or MANUAL The scenario part to export into Steps section of Test Case work item, the remaining scenario part is exported into Summary section. azure-devops-exporter.create-test-run false true or false Whether to create test run. In Azure DevOps only Test Cases with associated automation can be included into automated Test Run. The associated automation is automatically added by exported only for Automated Test Cases. Attempts to include Manual Test Case into automated Test Run will fail the execution process. azure-devops-exporter.test-run.name string The test run name. This property is mandatory when the test run creation is enabled, see azure-devops-exporter.create-test-run property for details. azure-devops-exporter.test-run.test-plan-id number The ID of Azure DevOps Test Plan that the Azure DevOps Test Run belongs to. In Azure DevOps Test Plan is used to group individual Test Cases and Test Suites, in their turn Test Suites are used to group Test Cases into separate testing scenarios within a single Test Plan and also may include child Test Suites. Azure DevOps allows to have an individual Test Case to be included into several Test Suites and into the Test Plan, BUT this is not supported by the exporter which requires the Test Case to be linked to either Test Plan or only one Test Suite, the export process fails if this condition is not met. This property is mandatory when the test run creation is enabled, see azure-devops-exporter.create-test-run property for details. The ID can be found by opening appropriate Azure DevOps Test Plan in \"Test Plans\" and copying number value of the planId query parameter in the page URL, e.g. having URL https://dev.azure.com/organization/project/_testPlans/define?planId=911 the plan ID is 911. Property Acceptable values Description azure-devops.username string Username from Azure DevOps azure-devops.password string Personal access token Name Example Description testCaseId @testCaseId 911 Map scenario to Azure DevOps test case in 1 to 1 relation azure-devops.skip-export @azure-devops.skip-export Skip test case while exporting This separation of automated and manual test cases by using special keywords is specific to VIVIDUS. Any scenario that doesn’t correspond to the manual test case rules is considered as automated test case. Example 1.

The Manual Test Case step must start with Step: used to specify action to perform and can optionally contain Data: and Result: for specifying action data and action expected result respectively. The Manual Test Case step parts are allowed to have multiple lines. The JBehave Keywords values (e.g. Given, When, Then …​) on new lines not prefixed with Step:, Data: or Result must be escaped with - sign. Example 3.

Write a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. The step logs the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. When I put record `$data` with partition key `$partitionKey` to Kinesis stream `$streamName` $data - The data blob to put into the record. $partitionKey - The partition key determining which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to put the data record into. Example 2. Put the record to the Amazon Kinesis data stream When I put record `Hello from Vividus!` with partition key `hello` to Kinesis stream `vividus-data-stream` Create Amazon Kinesis shard iterators. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream `$streamName` $streamName - The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream. Get data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard and drain the consumed records to the specified variable. The shard iterator created at step When I start consuming records from Kinesis stream \\$streamName\\`` specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, an empty list of records is saved. Each draining moves the iterator to the position next after the last consumed record. When I drain consumed Kinesis records to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the records. The records are accessible via zero-based index, e.g. ${my-var[0]} will return the first received record. Example 3.

The plugin attempts to find AWS credentials by using the default credential provider chain. The provider chain looks for credentials using the provided below options one by one starting from the top. If credentials are found at some point, the search stops and further options are not evaluated. The AWS credentials scoped to either current scenario or story (configured via the corresponding step). Environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (the optional variable for session token is AWS_SESSION_TOKEN). The properties: system.aws.accessKeyId and system.aws.secretKey (the optional property for session token is system.aws.sessionToken). Web Identity Token credentials from the environment or container. In the default credentials file (the location of this file varies by platform). Credentials delivered through the Amazon EC2 container service if the AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI environment variable is set and security manager has permission to access the variable. In the instance profile credentials, which exist within the instance metadata associated with the IAM role for the EC2 instance. This step is available only when running your application on an Amazon EC2 instance, but provides the greatest ease of use and best security when working with Amazon EC2 instances. If the plugin still hasn’t found credentials by this point, client creation fails with an exception. See the official \"Working with AWS Credentials\" guide to get more details. The plugin attempts to find AWS region by using the default region provider chain. The provider chain looks for a region using the provided below options one by one starting from the top. If region is found at some point, the search stops and further options are not evaluated. Environment variable: AWS_REGION. The property: system.aws.region.

Upload the specified data to Amazon S3 under the specified bucket and key name. When I upload data `$data` with key `$objectKey` and content type `$contentType` to S3 bucket `$bucketName` $data - the data to be uploaded $objectKey - the key under which to store the specified data $contentType - the MIME type of data $bucketName - the name of an existing bucket Example 2. Upload data to Amazon S3 When I upload data `{\"my\":\"json\"}` with key `folder/name.json` and content type `application/json` to S3 bucket `testBucket` Retrieve the object by key from the provided S3 bucket and save its content to a variable. The specified bucket and object key must exist, or an error will result. When I fetch object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $objectKey - the key under which the desired object is stored $bucketName - the name of the bucket containing the desired object $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - the variable name Example 3. Download S3 object When I fetch object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` and save result to scenario variable `my-json-var` Set the canned access control list (ACL) for the specified object in Amazon S3. Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy. When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error. When I set ACL `$cannedAcl` for object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` $cannedAcl - The new pre-configured canned ACL for the specified object. (See the official documentation for a complete list of the available ACLs) $objectKey - The key of the object within the specified bucket whose ACL is being set. $bucketName - The name of the bucket containing the object whose ACL is being set Example 4. Set public READ permission When I set ACL `public-read` for object with key `/path/file.json` from S3 bucket `some-bucket-name` Collects a list of the S3 objects keys in the specified bucket. Because buckets can contain a virtually unlimited number of keys, the complete results can be extremely large, thus it’s recommended to use filters to retrieve the filtered dataset. When I collect objects keys filtered by:$filters in S3 bucket `$bucketName` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $filters - The ExamplesTable with filters to be applied to the objects to limit the resulting set. Table 1.

Once deleted, the object can only be restored if versioning was enabled when the object was deleted. If attempting to delete an object that does not exist, Amazon S3 returns a success message instead of an error message. When I delete object with key `$objectKey` from S3 bucket `$bucketName` $objectKey - The key of the object to delete. $bucketName - The name of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the object to delete.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for Java, which defines how a client may access a database. Every JDBC requires using specific driver. JDBC drivers are client-side adapters (installed on the client machine, not on the server) that convert requests from Java programs to a protocol that the database management system (DBMS) can understand. Copy the below line code to dependencies section of the project build.gradle file Example 1. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.vividus', name: 'vividus-plugin-db', version: '0.6.1-SNAPSHOT') Define your JDBC driver and add appropriate dependency. Let’s take PostgreSQL as an example: Open JDBC page on maven repository; Find driver for your database and open details (PostgreSQL JDBC Driver); Choose and open version (42.5.4); Go to the Gradle tab and copy implementation string; Paste chosen dependency into your build.gradle file: Example 2. build.gradle implementation(group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.6.0') In case Maven repository does not contain driver you need, please refer to the documentation of your database to define suitable JDBC driver. If the project was imported to the IDE before adding new plugin, re-generate the configuration files for the used IDE and then refresh the project in the used IDE. For database interaction, you will need to set related properties. They have db.connection. prefix followed by the database connection name (vividus in the example). Come up with your own database name to use within the tests. Put properties into the environment.properties file: Example 3. environment.properties db.connection.vividus.url=jdbc:dbms://databaseUrl:port/databaseName?parameter1=true¶meter2=value (1) db.connection.vividus.username= (2) db.connection.vividus.password= (2) db.connection.vividus.driver-class-name=(3) 1 Database address. Consists of: jdbc: - reference to JDBC; dbms: - Database Management System, e.g. postgresql; //databaseUrl - address to your database; :port - port number, e.g. 5432; /databaseName - name of your database; parameters - any additional driver parameters you need to pass; URL structure slightly changes depending on the database management system. You can find templates for different DBMS in setup examples. 2 Credentials for given database connection; 3 Driver class name (Optional), e.g. org.postgresql.Driver. You might need it to specify the driver name for the exact database. Here are some examples of setting different databases connection for most popular DBMS-s.

Example 18. Validate the number of accounts in JSON is equal to 2 Then number of JSON elements from ` [ { \"accountId\": 843 }, { \"accountId\": 233 } ] ` by JSON path `$..accountId` is equal to 2 Validates JSON against JSON Schema. Then JSON `$json` is valid against schema `$schema` $json - The JSON to validate. $schema - The JSON Schema. The step validates JSON according to schema specification version provided in the schema itself, e.g.: \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\" If the version is not present in the schema then JSON is validated according to 2020-12 version. Example 19. Validate product for sale information Then JSON ` { \"productId\": 1, \"productName\": \"A desk lamp\", \"price\": 12.50, \"tags\": [ \"lamp\", \"desk\" ] } ` is valid against schema ` { \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\", \"$id\": \"https://example.com/product.schema.json\", \"title\": \"Product\", \"description\": \"A product from catalog\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"productId\": { \"description\": \"The unique identifier for a product\", \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"productName\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"price\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"exclusiveMinimum\": 0 }, \"tags\": { \"description\": \"Tags for the product\", \"type\": \"array\", \"prefixItems\": [{ \"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"lamp\", \"desk\"] }], \"minItems\": 1, \"uniqueItems\": true } }, \"required\": [ \"productId\", \"productName\", \"price\", \"tags\" ] } ` Matcher is an object which compares objects against a specific criteria and returns a boolean value indicating whether the match was successful or not. Embedded matchers, placeholders and expressions can be found on the json-unit library readme.

Given I start mobile application Starts mobile application with capabilities from user’s *.properties files and profiles set by a user. Additionally the step takes a list of capabilities as an argument that overrides globally-defined capabilities. Given I start mobile application with capabilities:$capabilities $capabilities - The capabilities to start application with, these capabilities have higher priority than capabilities defined in *.properties files and profiles. Example 11. Start mobile application with 2 custom capabilities Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |bstack:options.networkLogs |true | |appium:options.clearSystemFiles|false| Activates the existing application on the device/emulator/simulator and moves it to the foreground. The application should be already running in order to activate it. When I activate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 12. Switch to Safari browser application When I activate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Removes the mobile application from device/emulator/simulator and installs it again. When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS. The key benefit is that instead of the full remote session recreation (which includes device re-allocation in testing clouds, like SauceLabs, BrowserStack, etc.) achivable via the following example: When I close mobile application Given I start mobile application with capabilities: |name |value| |fullReset|true | the step re-uses the current session which significantly improves performance. Example 13. Reinstall mobile application When I reinstall mobile application with bundle identifier `vividus-mobile.app` Terminates the running application on the device/emulator/simulator and navigates to the home device screen. The remote session will not be closed. When I terminate application with bundle identifier `$bundleId` $bundleId - Package name for Android or Bundle identifier from Plist.info for iOS Example 14. Terminates Safari browser application When I terminate application with bundle identifier `com.apple.mobilesafari` Closes the mobile application and quits the remote session. When I close mobile application Runs mobile application in the background for specific period of time and either activates the app after a certain amount of time, or leave the app deactivated (when PT-1S is used). See Appium docs for more details. When I send mobile application to background for `$period` period $period - The period of time in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 15. Run app in background When I send mobile application to background for `PT5S` period Then number of elements found by `accessibilityId(login-button)` is equal to `1` Changes the behavior of the Appium session. When I change Appium session settings:$settings $settings - The iOS or Android settings to set. Example 16. Configure to show invisible elements When I change Appium session settings: |name |value| |allowInvisibleElements|true | Uploads a file to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file `$filePath` to device $filePath - The path of the file to upload to the device. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 17. Upload file When I upload file `images/avatar.png` to device Then the avatar icon is displayed with the uploaded image Upload the file with data to the device/emulator/simulator. When I upload file with name `$fileName` and data `$data` to device $data - The data to store as a file. $fileName - The name of the uploaded file. The destination folder on the device for the uploaded file is configured by mobile-environment.device.folder-for-file-upload property. See more information in the properties section. Example 18. Upload the file with the image data to the device When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vividus-framework/vividus/master/vividus-tests/src/main/resources/baselines/context.png` When I upload file with name `context.png` and data `${response-as-bytes}` to device Then image is displayed in gallery Example 19. Upload the file with the text data to the device When I upload file with name `message.txt` and data `This is a message` to device Then message file is displayed in file explorer Deletes a file from the device/emulator/simulator. When I delete file `$filePath` from device Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be downloaded/deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to download/delete a file from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type for real devices is documents. Containers available for Simulators: app, data, groups, . If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a specially formatted path, which points to an item inside an app bundle, for example @my.app.id/my/path. It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format. /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle Example 20. Delete file When I delete file `/sdcard/Pictures/avatar.png` from device On iOS real device to add or delete photo or video to/from \"Camera Roll\" you need upload/delete photos or videos to/from /DCIM/100APPLE/ folder and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. Restart device is necessary after that. On iOS simulator to delete photo or video from \"Camera Roll\" you need to delete photo or video from /Media/DCIM/100APPLE/ and then trigger a rebuild of the \"Camera Roll\" database by deleting the old databases. You can accomplish it by deleting following files: /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-shm, /Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite-wal. And then restart simulator. Downloads the file from the device/emulator/simulator and saves its content to a variable. When I download file `$filePath` from device and save its content to $scopes variable `$variableName` Argument Platform Description Examples $filePath iOS The path to an existing remote file on the device. This variable can be prefixed with bundle id, so then the file will be downloaded/deleted from the corresponding application container instead of the default media folder. Use @:/ format to download/delete a file from an application container of the given type. The only supported container type for real devices is documents. Containers available for Simulators: app, data, groups, . If the container type is not set explicitly for a bundle id, then the default application container is going to be mounted (aka --container ifuse argument) e.g. If @com.myapp.bla:documents/111.png is provided, On My iPhone/ in Files app will be mounted to the host machine. `@com.myapp.bla:documents/ means On My iPhone/. /DCIM/100APPLE/image.png or @com.mycompany.myapp:documents/myfile.txt Android The full path to the remote file or a specially formatted path, which points to an item inside an app bundle, for example @my.app.id/my/path. It is mandatory for the app bundle to have debugging enabled in order to use the latter remotePath format. /sdcard/myfile.txt or @my.app.id/path/in/bundle $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the file content. Example 21. Download file When I download file `/sdcard/file.json` from device and save its content to scenario variable `json-file` Switches context to a web view with name that matches the rule (see Automating hybrid apps for more information).

It is based on the Instruments utility distributed by Xcode which provides a number of built-in analyses and measurements. See Capturing Performance Data for Native iOS Apps and Getting Started with Instruments for more information. Appium server should be started with the --relaxed-security flag. This is because Instruments can gather data from the system as a whole, not just the AUT. (It’s thus a security risk to expose potentially sensitive system information to Appium sessions running from a remote client). Archive with results contains *.trace file which could be opened by XCode. There is possibility to parse this file using XCode’s utility xctrace and use generated data in tests When I start recording `$instrument` metrics When I stop recording `$instrument` metrics and save results to file `$path` $instrument - The instrument of Xcode Instruments utility. Some useful instruments: Time Profiler, Leaks, File Activity, etc. $path - The path to the file to save an archive with collected data. Example 41. Perform profiling during application usage When I start recording `Time Profiler` metrics !-- set of actions to measure performance When I stop recording `Time Profiler` metrics and save results to file `${outputDirectory}/time_profiler.zip` Sets the slider value in percents. The accuracy of setting the slider value is not guaranteed and may vary depending on the device screen resolution. The target element must be of type XCUIElementTypeSlider. The percent number must be between 0 and 100 inclusively. When I set value of iOS slider located `$locator` to `$percent` percents $locator - The locator to find XCUIElementTypeSlider element. $percent - The target value of the slider in percents. Example 42. Set value of iOS slider (with range 0:50) to 45 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `90` percents Example 43. Set value of iOS slider (with range -50:50) to 20 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `70` percents Example 44. Set value of iOS slider (with range 18:65) to 55 When I set value of iOS slider located `xpath(//XCUIElementTypeSlider)` to `80` percents Sets the slider value to the number relatively to the slider leftmost side of its range. The step is expected to set accurate value without deviations. The target element must be of type android.widget.SeekBar. The number must be greater than or equal to 0. Make sure the passed number does not exceed the right limit of the slider, this may lead to unexpected failure. When I set value of Android slider located `$locator` to `$number` $locator - The locator to find android.widget.SeekBar element. $number - The number to set on the slider Example 45.

Example 48. Take a screenshot and save it to the file When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `${screenshot-directory}/start-page.png` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 49. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 50. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for an element with the specified state to be found using the specified timeout with polling interval.

In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 52. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 53. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Waits for element with the specified locator to stop moving. An element is considered moving when its coordinates (position) are changing. For example, an animated GIF is not a moving element unless it changes position. When I wait until element located by `$locator` stops moving $locator - Locator. Example 54. Wait for element with the specified id to stop moving When I wait until element located by `id(submitForm)` stops moving Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 55. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 56. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Saves text of an element into a variable.

Example 76. Validate the URL of the matching HTTP request Given I start mobile application When I capture HTTP GET or POST request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL to scenario variable `URL` Then `${URL}` is equal to `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` Example 77. Validate the URL query of the matching HTTP request Given I start mobile application When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `.*/search.*=vividus` and save URL query to scenario variable `query` Then `${query.q[0]}` is equal to `vividus` Then `${query.q}` is equal to `[vividus]` Then `${query}` is equal to `{q=[vividus]}` Example 78. Validate the request data from the matching HTTP message Given I start mobile application When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` and save request data to scenario variable `data` Then `${data.query}` is equal to `{}` Then `${data.requestBodyParameters}` is equal to `{delivery=, custtel=, comments=, custemail=, custname=}` Then `${data.requestBody}` is not equal to `null` Then `${data.responseStatus}` is equal to `200` Example 79. Validate the response data from the matching HTTP message Given I start mobile application When I capture HTTP GET request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` and save request data to scenario variable `data` Then `${data.responseBody.text}` is equal to `{\"status\": \"ok\"}` Then `${data.responseBody.mimeType}` is equal to `application/json` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level. Waits for the HTTP requests matching the provided HTTP methods and URL regular expression. If no HTTP request is sent and wait timeout is reached, then the step will fail. When I wait until HTTP $httpMethods request with URL pattern `$urlPattern` exists in proxy log $httpMethods - the \"or\"-separated HTTP methods to filter by, e.g. 'GET or POST or PUT' $urlPattern - the regular expression to match HTTP request URL Example 80. Wait for the HTTP request Given I start mobile application When I wait until HTTP GET or POST request with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` exists in proxy log Then number of HTTP GET or POST requests with URL pattern `https://www.google.com/search?q=vividus` is equal to `1` This step requires proxy to be turned on. It can be done in properties or by switching on @proxy meta tag at the story level.

The name of the cookie specification to be used for HTTP state management Example 6. Load a page with slow connection and with the property http.socket-timeout set to 15000 When I set HTTP request configuration: |socketTimeout | |25000 | When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/?pageTimeout=20000` Then '${responseStatusCode}' is = '200' Sets HTTP request body that will be used while executing the request. In the case of textual content the default HTTP request header with name Content-Type and value text/plain; charset=UTF-8 is set. No HTTP request header is set in the case of binary content. Given request body: $content $content - HTTP request body. Example 7. Set textual HTTP request body Given request body: Hello! Example 8. Set binary HTTP request body Given request body: #{loadBinaryResource(/data/image.png)} When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|image/png| When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with relative URL `/upload/png` Sets multipart request entity that will be used while executing HTTP requests. Given multipart request:$requestParts where requestParts is ExamplesTable representing the list of the request parts with the following columns: type - One of request part types: STRING, FILE, BINARY. name - The request part name. value - For FILE part type - the resource name or the file path. For STRING or BINARY part type - the actual content. contentType - The content type. fileName - The name of the file contained in this request part. The parameter is not allowed for STRING part type, but it’s required for BINARY one and optional for FILE part type. Example 9. Init HTTP request consisting of 4 different parts Given I initialize scenario variable `temp-file-content` with value `Your first and last stop for No-Code Test Automation!` When I create temporary file with name `abc.txt` and content `${temp-file-content}` and put path to scenario variable `temp-file-path` Given multipart request: |type |name |value |contentType|fileName | |file |file-key |/data/file.txt | |anotherName.txt| |file |file-key2 |${temp-file-path}|text/plain | | |string|string-key|string1 |text/plain | | |binary|binary-key|raw |text/plain |raw.txt | Sets URL-encoded form data request entity that will be used while executing HTTP requests.

In case if Content-Type is text/plain Set HTTP request body should be used Given form data request:$parameters $parameters - The ExamplesTable representing list of parameters with columns name and value specifying form data request. Example 10. Set form data HTTP request body Given form data request: |name |value | |firstName|Ivan | |lastName |Ivanov | |password |!@3qwer| Adds HTTP headers to the existing HTTP headers of the building HTTP request. The added HTTP headers are scoped to the first performed HTTP request and not available afterwards. When I add request headers:$headers headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns name and value specifying HTTP header. Example 11. Add request header with name Accept-Language and value en-us When I add request headers: |name |value | |Accept-Language|en-us | When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with relative URL `/get?name=Content` When I save JSON element value from `${response}` by JSON path `$.headers.Accept-Language` to scenario variable `language` Then `${language}` is equal to `\"en-us\"` Sets HTTP headers to the building HTTP request. Previously set HTTP headers are discarded. The added HTTP headers are scoped to the first performed HTTP request and not available afterwards. When I set request headers:$headers headers - The ExamplesTable representing the list of the headers with columns name and value specifying HTTP header. Example 12. Set request header with name Content-Type and value application/json When I set request headers: |name |value | |Content-Type|application/json| Given request body: { \"type\": \"article\" } When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `https://api.example.com/entries` Executes the HTTP request for a resource identified by the absolute URL.

When I execute HTTP $httpMethod request for resource with URL `$url` $httpMethod - The HTTP method. $url - The URL of the resource on the server. Example 13. Execute HTTP GET request When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Executes the HTTP request for a resource identified by the URL relative to the base URL specified by the rest-api.http.endpoint property. The step uses previously set HTTP headers and request body. The HTTP response headers, status code and body can be accessed via the corresponding steps and dynamic variables. When I execute HTTP $httpMethod request for resource with relative URL `$relativeURL` $httpMethod - The HTTP method. $relativeURL - The relative URL of the resource on the server. Example 14. Configuration rest-api.http.endpoint=https://httpbin.org Example 15. Execute HTTP GET request When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with relative URL `/image/jpeg` Compares the HTTP response body against the resource data according to the provided rule. Then response body $validationRule resource at `$resourcePath` $validationRule - The validation rule, either is equal to or is not equal to. $resourcePath - The resource path. Example 16. Compare images When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/image/png` Then response body is equal to resource at `/images/pig.png` Compares the HTTP response status code against the expected number. Then response code is $comparisonRule `$responseCode` $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $responseCode - The expected HTTP response status code. Example 17. Validate the resource is not found When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cfa2fdbc` Then response code is equal to `404` Compares the HTTP response time against the expected number in milliseconds. Then response time is $comparisonRule `$responseTime` milliseconds $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $responseTime - The expected response time in milliseconds. Example 18. Check HTTP response time When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Then response time is less than `1000` milliseconds Validates the number of HTTP response headers filtered by the specified name. Then number of response headers with name `$headerName` is $comparisonRule $number $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of headers. Example 19. Check the browser is forced to use a secure web connection Then number of response headers with name `Strict-Transport-Security` is equal to 1 Compares the header value against the expected value according to the comparison rule. Then value of response header `$headerName` $comparisonRule `$value` $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $comparisonRule - The string comparison rule. $number - The expected HTTP header value. Example 20. Check HTTP response content type When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/robots.txt` Then value of response header `Content-Type` is equal to `text/plain` Validates that the response header with the specified name contains elements. Might be useful to verify such HTTP headers as Set-Cookie that have values that can be decomposed into multiple elements. Example 21. HTTP header with elements format header = [ element ] *( \",\" [ element ] ) Then response header `$headerName` contains elements:$elements $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $attributes - The ExamplesTable with expected elements. Example 22. Check attributes of Set-Cookie header When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/authenticate` Then response header `Set-Cookie` contains elements: |element | |JSESSION| |clientId| Saves the HTTP response header value into a variable. When I save response header `$headerName` value to $scopes variable `$variableName` $headerName - The HTTP response header name. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to store the header value. Example 23. Save Content-Length header value When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/brotli` When I save response header `Content-Length` value to scenario variable `length` Validates that the HTTP connection is secured with the defined security protocol. Then connection is secured using $securityProtocol protocol $securityProtocol - The expected security protocol, e.g. TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 Example 24. Check that the httpbin is secured When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/` Then connection is secured using TLSv1.2 protocol Waits for a specified amount of time until HTTP response body contains an element by the specified JSON path. The actions of the step: Execute sub-steps. Check if the HTTP response is present and the response body contains an element by JSON path. If the required JSON element exists or the maximum number of retries is reached, then the execution stops, otherwise the step actions are repeated. Stop step execution if HTTP response is not present or JSON element is found, otherwise sleep for the calculated part of specified duration and repeat actions from the start. When I wait for presence of element by `$jsonPath` for `$duration` duration retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute $jsonPath - The JSON path of the element to find. $duration - The time duration to wait in ISO-8601 Durations format. $retryTimes - The maximum of attempts. duration/retryTimes = timeout is a polling timeout between requests. $stepsToExecute - The sub-steps to execute at each iteration. Example 25. Wait for presence of element 10 times with polling timeout between requests 5 seconds When I wait for presence of element by `$.unstableElement` for `PT50S` duration retrying 10 times |step | |When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `http://example.com/testing-page` | Executes the provided sub-steps until the HTTP response body contains an element by the specified JSON path or the maximum number of retries is reached. The maximum duration of the step execution is not limited. The actions of the step: execute sub-steps wait the polling interval if the required JSON element exists or the maximum number of retries is reached, then the execution stops, otherwise the step actions are repeated When I wait for presence of element by `$jsonPath` with `$pollingInterval` polling interval retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute jsonPath - the JSON path of the element to find pollingInterval - the duration to wait between retries retryTimes - the maximum number of the retries stepsToExecute - the sub-steps to execute at each iteration Example 26.

Then server `$hostname` supports secure protocols that $rule `$protocols` $hostname - the server hostname $rule - the collection comparison rule $protocols - the secure protocols that are expected to match specified $rule Example 27. Validate the server supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 protocols Then server `vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com` supports secure protocols that contain `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3` Waits for the specified number of times until HTTP response code is equal to the expected one. In case if the expected code is not returned after all retries, the assertion error will be recorded. When I wait for response code $responseCode for $duration duration retrying $retryTimes times$stepsToExecute $responseCode - The expected HTTP status code. $duration - The time duration to wait in ISO-8601 Durations format. $retryTimes - The number of times the request will be retried: duration/retryTimes = timeout is a polling timeout between requests. $stepsToExecute - The steps to execute at each wait iteration. Example 28. Wait until HTTP GET request returns status code 200 When I wait for response code `200` for `PT10S` duration retrying 3 times |step | |When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with relative URL `/delayed-resource` | Checks content type of HTTP response body matches to the specified expected content type according to the provided string validation rule. Then content type of response body $comparisonRule `$contentType` $comparisonRule - String validation rule. $contentType – Expected content type, e.g. text/html, application/xml, application/json. Example 29. Submit a GET request and check that response body type is application/json When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then content type of response body is equal to `application/json` Validates that the HTTP response does not contain a body. Then response does not contain body Example 30. Submit a POST request and check that response body is absent When I execute HTTP POST request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then response does not contain body Compare size of decompressed HTTP response body with the specified expected size in bytes. Then size of decompressed response body is $comparisonRule `$sizeInBytes` $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $sizeInBytes - The expected size of the response body in bytes. Example 31. Submit a GET request and check that response body size is greater or equal to 1200 bytes When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://example.com` Then size of decompressed response body is greater than or equal to `1200` The step is moved to core package i.e. it’s not required to install any plugin to use this step - it’s available out of the box. The step is moved to core package i.e. it’s not required to install any plugin to use this step - it’s available out of the box. Validates the defined HTTP resources Actions performed by step: executes HTTP HEAD request against the passed URL if the status code is 200 then the check is considered as passed if the status code falls under any of 404, 405, 501, 503 then the HTTP GET request will be sent if the GET status code is 200 then check is considered as passed, otherwise failed if the target URL has already been checked then the check is considered as skipped Then HTTP resources are valid:$resources resources - The URLs of HTTP resources to validate Example 32. Verify HTTP resources Then HTTP resources are valid: | url | | https://saucelabs.com | | https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/img/vividus.png | Saves cookie to scope variable. If present several cookies with the same name will be saved cookie with the root path value (path is '/'). When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `$cookieName` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of cookie. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of variable. Example 33. Get cookie with name cookieName and save its value to scenario variable value When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue` When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value` Then '${value}' is equal to 'cookieValue' Change cookie value. If several cookies with the same name exist in cookie store, the value will be changed for all of them. When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `$cookieName` to `$newCookieValue` $cookieName - The name of cookie. $newCookieValue - The new value for $cookieName. Example 34. Get cookie with name cookieName and set new value for it newCookieValue When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/cookieName/cookieValue` When I change value of all HTTP cookies with name `cookieName` to `newCookieValue` When I save value of HTTP cookie with name `cookieName` to scenario variable `value` Then '${value}' is equal to 'newCookieValue' The step is moved to vividus-plugin-json. The step is moved to vividus-plugin-json. The step is moved to vividus-plugin-json. The step is moved to vividus-plugin-json. Generates JSON Web Token (JWT) with header and payload signed with secret key using HmacSHA256 algorithm and saves the result to scope variable with the specified name. When I generate JWT with header `$header` and payload `$payload` signed with key `$key` using HS256 algorithm and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $header - The header of JWT. $payload - The payload of JWT. $key - Secret key used by HS256 algorithm to sign the token. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of variable to save the result. Example 35. Generate JWT with specified payload and header signed with key secretKey using HS256 algorithm and save result to scenario variable JWT Given I initialize scenario variable `header` with value `{\"typ\":\"JWT\",\"alg\":\"HS256\"}` Given I initialize scenario variable `payload` with value `{\"sub\":\"1234567890\",\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"admin\":true,\"jti\":\"c6859320-9fb3-4784-8c2f-1ab37044acfc\",\"iat\":#{toEpochSecond(#{generateDate(P, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)})},\"exp\":#{toEpochSecond(#{generateDate(P1D, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss)})}}` When I generate JWT with header `${header}` and payload `${payload}` signed with key `secretKey` using HS256 algorithm and save result to scenario variable `JWT` In order to validate the body of the latest HTTP response use the response dynamic variable to access the body data in conjunction with any step responsible for data validation like data comparison, JSON, XML and other steps. Example 36. Validate response body When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Then JSON element from `${response}` by JSON path `$.slideshow` is equal to ` { \"author\": \"Yours Truly\", \"date\": \"date of publication\", \"slides\": [ { \"title\": \"Wake up to WonderWidgets!\", \"type\": \"all\" }, { \"items\": [ \"Why WonderWidgets are great\", \"Who buys WonderWidgets\" ], \"title\": \"Overview\", \"type\": \"all\" } ], \"title\": \"Sample Slide Show\" } ` The HTTP response body can be saved into static variable by using the init variable step in conjunction with the response dynamic variable, it might be useful if you want to preserve the data for further computations since each subsequent HTTP call rewrites previously received response data. Example 37. Save response body into variable When I execute HTTP GET request for resource with URL `https://httpbin.org/json` Given I initialize scenario variable `json` with value `${response}`","title":"REST API Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-rest-api","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-rest-api.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Properties","hash":"_properties","id":2},{"text":"Expressions","hash":"_expressions","id":3},{"text":"removeWrappingDoubleQuotes","hash":"_removewrappingdoublequotes","id":4},{"text":"encodeUriXyz","hash":"_encodeurixyz","id":5},{"text":"Dynamic variables","hash":"_dynamic_variables","id":6},{"text":"HTTP response as text","hash":"_http_response_as_text","id":7},{"text":"HTTP response as binary data","hash":"_http_response_as_binary_data","id":8},{"text":"HTTP response code","hash":"_http_response_code","id":9},{"text":"HTTP Steps","hash":"_http_steps","id":10},{"text":"Set HTTP request configuration","hash":"_set_http_request_configuration","id":11},{"text":"Set HTTP request body","hash":"_set_http_request_body","id":12},{"text":"Prepare multipart HTTP request","hash":"_prepare_multipart_http_request","id":13},{"text":"Set form data HTTP request","hash":"_set_form_data_http_request","id":14},{"text":"Add HTTP headers to the request","hash":"_add_http_headers_to_the_request","id":15},{"text":"Set HTTP headers to the request","hash":"_set_http_headers_to_the_request","id":16},{"text":"Execute HTTP request with absolute URL","hash":"_execute_http_request_with_absolute_url","id":17},{"text":"Execute HTTP request with relative URL","hash":"_execute_http_request_with_relative_url","id":18},{"text":"Compare HTTP response body against resource","hash":"_compare_http_response_body_against_resource","id":19},{"text":"Validate HTTP response code","hash":"_validate_http_response_code","id":20},{"text":"Validate HTTP response time","hash":"_validate_http_response_time","id":21},{"text":"Valdate number of HTTP response headers","hash":"_valdate_number_of_http_response_headers","id":22},{"text":"Validate HTTP response header value","hash":"_validate_http_response_header_value","id":23},{"text":"Validate HTTP response header elements","hash":"_validate_http_response_header_elements","id":24},{"text":"Save HTTP response header value","hash":"_save_http_response_header_value","id":25},{"text":"Validate connection security","hash":"_validate_connection_security","id":26},{"text":"Wait for JSON element in the HTTP response","hash":"_wait_for_json_element_in_the_http_response","id":27},{"text":"Wait for JSON element in the HTTP response with polling interval","hash":"_wait_for_json_element_in_the_http_response_with_polling_interval","id":28},{"text":"Validate secure protocols supported by server","hash":"_validate_secure_protocols_supported_by_server","id":29},{"text":"Wait for expected HTTP status code in response","hash":"_wait_for_expected_http_status_code_in_response","id":30},{"text":"Validate content type of response body","hash":"_validate_content_type_of_response_body","id":31},{"text":"Validate absence of response body","hash":"_validate_absence_of_response_body","id":32},{"text":"Validate size of response body","hash":"_validate_size_of_response_body","id":33},{"text":"Save ZIP archive entries","hash":"_save_zip_archive_entries","id":34},{"text":"Validate ZIP archive","hash":"_validate_zip_archive","id":35},{"text":"Validate HTTP resources","hash":"_validate_http_resources","id":36},{"text":"HTTP cookie steps","hash":"_http_cookie_steps","id":37},{"text":"Save value of HTTP cookie","hash":"_save_value_of_http_cookie","id":38},{"text":"Change value of all HTTP cookies","hash":"_change_value_of_all_http_cookies","id":39},{"text":"JSON Steps","hash":"_json_steps","id":40},{"text":"Verify JSON contains data","hash":"_verify_json_contains_data","id":41},{"text":"Verify number of elements in JSON","hash":"_verify_number_of_elements_in_json","id":42},{"text":"Save element from JSON","hash":"_save_element_from_json","id":43},{"text":"Save number of elements from JSON","hash":"_save_number_of_elements_from_json","id":44},{"text":"JWT steps","hash":"_jwt_steps","id":45},{"text":"Generate JWT","hash":"_generate_jwt","id":46},{"text":"Tips & Tricks","hash":"_tips_tricks","id":47},{"text":"Validate HTTP response body","hash":"_validate_http_response_body","id":48},{"text":"Save HTTP response body into variable","hash":"_save_http_response_body_into_variable","id":49}]},"61":{"id":61,"text":"The plugin provides integration with continuous testing cloud SauceLabs.

Usage example Examples: {transformer=FROM_HEADLESS_CRAWLING, column=page-url} Validates resources on web pages Resource validation logic: If the pages row contains relative URL then it gets resolved against URL in web-application.main-page-url property, i.e. if the main page URL is https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/ and relative URL is /skyrim10 the resulting URL will be https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/skyrim10 Collect elements by the CSS selector from each page Get either href or src attribute value from each element, if neither of the attributes exists the validation fails For each received value execute HEAD request If the status code is 200 OK then the resource validation is considered as passed If the status code is one of 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 501 Not Implemented, 503 Service Unavailable then GET request will be executed If the GET status code is 200 OK then the resource validation is considered as passed, otherwise failed Then all resources by selector `$cssSelector` are valid on:$pages $cssSelector - The CSS selector $pages - The pages to validate resources on Example 4. Validate resources Then all resources by selector `a` are valid on: |pages | |https://vividus.org/ | |/test-automation-made-awesome| Check that all URLs from ExamplesTable redirect to proper pages with correct redirects number. Validation fails if either actual final URL or number of redirects do not match the expected values. The step throws the error in case if HTTP response status code of checked URL out of range 200-207. Then I validate HTTP redirects: $expectedRedirects $expectedRedirects - The ExamplesTable with redirect parameters containing the following columns: startUrl - The URL from which redirection starts. endUrl - The expected final URL to redirect to. redirectsNumber - The expected number of redirects between startUrl and endUrl (optional). Example 5. Validate redirects Then I validate HTTP redirects: |startUrl |endUrl |redirectsNumber | |http://example.com/redirect |http://example.com/get-response |1 | Performs SSL scanning using SSL Labs and compares received grade value with expected one. Then SSL rating for URL `$url` is $comparisonRule `$gradeName` $url - The URL for SSL scanning and grading. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $gradeName - The name of grade. The possible values: A+, A, A-, B, C, D, E, F, T, M. Table 1. Properties Property Name Acceptable values Default Description ssl-labs.api-endpoint URL https://api.ssllabs.com SSL Labs endpoint. Example 6. Validate SSL rating for https://www.google.com Then SSL rating for URL `https://www.google.com` is equal to `B`","title":"Web Application & REST API Integration Plugin","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"plugin-web-app-to-rest-api","url":"/vividus/latest/plugins/plugin-web-app-to-rest-api.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Table Transformers","hash":"_table_transformers","id":2},{"text":"FROM_SITEMAP","hash":"_from_sitemap","id":3},{"text":"Required properties","hash":"_required_properties","id":4},{"text":"FROM_HEADLESS_CRAWLING","hash":"_from_headless_crawling","id":5},{"text":"Required properties","hash":"_required_properties_2","id":6},{"text":"Steps","hash":"_steps","id":7},{"text":"Validate resources","hash":"_validate_resources","id":8},{"text":"Validate redirects","hash":"_validate_redirects","id":9},{"text":"Validate SSL rating","hash":"_validate_ssl_rating","id":10}]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"The plugin provides functionality to interact with Web applications.

Here is an example how to configure third-party cookies behaviour. Example 6. Add the following property to allow all cookies web.driver.chrome.experimental-options={\"prefs\": {\"profile\": {\"cookie_controls_mode\": 0}}} The allowed values for the preference from the example are: 0 - allow all cookies; 1 - block third-party cookies; 2 - block third-party cookies in Incognito mode only. @proxy - some steps require proxy to be turned on: it can be done by setting the corresponding properties or by switching on this meta tag at story level. The expression parameters marked with bold are mandatory. Parses Data URL-s and decodes their data if Base64 encoding is set. The result of the expression depends on the MIME type of Data URL. The result will be a binary data in case of the binary MIME type and it will be a string for the text MIME type. If expression is applied to invalid Data URL the error will be thrown. #{decodeDataUrl($dataUrl)} $dataUrl - The Data URL to decode. Example 7. Decoding inlined image When I save `src` attribute value of element located by `id(image)` to scenario variable `image` When I compare against baseline with name `inlined-image` from image `#{decodeDataUrl(${image})}` Table 1. Examples of the expressions decoding Data URL Expression Result #{decodeDataUrl(data:,value)} value #{decodeDataUrl(data:text/plain,value)} value #{decodeDataUrl(data:;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==)} Hello, World! #{decodeDataUrl(data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==)} Hello, World! #{decodeDataUrl(data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==)} Hello, World! #{decodeDataUrl(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw…​.)} Image binary data. The variable provides the URL of the page currently loaded in the browser. ${current-page-url} Example 8. Validate redirect in the browser Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then `${current-page-url}` is equal to `https://docs.vividus.dev/vividus/latest/index.html` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access height and width of the browser window. Variable name Description browser-window-height the height of the browser window browser-window-width the width of the browser window Example 9. Check the dimension of the browser window When I change window size to `800x600` Then `${browser-window-width}` is = `800` Then `${browser-window-height}` is = `600` The set of dynamic variables provides ability to access context element coordinates, width and height. The variables rely on the contextual approach: it is necessary to switch context to the target element. In case of missing search context the error will be logged and -1 will be returned as a result Variable name Description context-height the height of the context element context-width the width of the context element context-x-coordinate the absolute X coordinate of the context element context-y-coordinate the absolute Y coordinate of the context element Example 10. Check the size and the location of the image When I change context to element located by `id(userpic)` Then `${context-height}` is > `0` Then `${context-width}` is > `0` Then `${context-x-coordinate}` is > `0` Then `${context-y-coordinate}` is > `0` Variable provides source code of the UI of the application under test. ${source-code} Example 11. Check if element exists on UI Then `${source-code}` matches `.+Home.+` Profiles allow to choose or parameterize browser that tests run on. See more details on the profiles and nesting strategy on the configuration page. Web-application plugin contains significant number of built-in profiles. They can be found after plugin installation by the following path in Eclipse IDE: Referenced Libraries -> vividus-plugin-web-app-X.Y.Z -> properties -> profile -> web Let’s go through the structure and review its content. General place for web profiles. Each of the directory contains browser related properties. This is a place for adjustments for your browser. Add there any properties you need: screen resolution, path to driver or to a custom browser. While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to use custom browser driver. This approach first requires manually downloading the driver (See Quick Reference Section for download links). The path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..driver-executable-path=/path/to/driver/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox safari iexplore edge opera While executing tests on the local machine it is allowed to configure path to browser executable file. In general cases it’s not required, installed browsers are found automatically (except Opera browser). Also, for example, if browser is not installed, but only downloaded and unpacked into some folder, the path to the downloaded binary should be configured using the following property: web.driver..binary-path=/path/to/custom/browser/executable where is one of the following values: chrome firefox edge opera Profile Example of properties web/desktop/chrome selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.chrome.command-line-arguments=--disable-auto-reload web/desktop/edge selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=12.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=MicrosoftEdge web/desktop/firefox selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 web.driver.firefox.command-line-arguments=--turbo web/desktop/iexplore selenium.grid.capabilities.browserName=internet explorer web.driver.iexplore.command-line-arguments=-private selenium.grid.capabilities.iedriverVersion=3.141.0 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=7 web/desktop/opera selenium.grid.screen-resolution=1920x1080 selenium.grid.platform-name=Windows selenium.grid.platform-version=10 In order to run tests in Opera browser locally, it is required to configure browser path. web/desktop/safari selenium.grid.platform-name=macOS selenium.grid.platform-version=11.00 Built-in devices Chrome allows to emulate view on mobile devices using Device mode. Such feature is reflected in mobile_emulation subdirectory in Profiles. Use device-name property to mention target device: web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.device-name=DEVICE_NAME Available for emulation devices you can find in the Dimensions list in chrome. Custom devices In case you need to use Responsive Viewport Mode and set up your own device, update the screen resolution in the following properties: web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.width=1440 web.driver.chrome.mobile-emulation.height=900 Headless mode is a functionality that allows the execution of a full version of the browser while controlling it programmatically. It can be used without dedicated graphics or display, meaning that it runs without its “head”, the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The following profiles running browsers in headless mode are available: web/headless/chrome web/headless/firefox The profile can be enabled by adding web/docker to configuration.profiles property. The profile should be used together with the browser profile. Default selenium grid URL is set to selenium.grid.url=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub. Don’t forget to modify it if your grid is running in a different location. Example 12. Run chrome in docker container configuraiton.profiles=web/docker,web/desktop/chrome Contains phone related properties, for android and iOS devices.

Main page can be set by the property web-application.main-page-url in the property file. Given I am on main application page Example 13. Open page defined in the web-application.main-page-url variable Given I am on main application page Loading the page with a given absolute URL, e.g. https://example.com/. Given I am on page with URL `$pageURL` Example 14. Open 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Navigates the browser to the specific path in the current host defined in the relative URL step parameter. A relative URL can point to a file within a web site (like about.html or /products). If the parameter starts with '/' char, navigation will be performed from the root of the host, see examples below. If the parameter starts without '/' char or with './', navigation will be performed from the current path directory. Table 2. Examples Current page Relative URL parameter Opened page https://mysite.com about.html https://mysite.com/about.html https://mysite.com /products/new https://mysite.com/products/new https://mysite.com/path/foo stats https://mysite.com/path/foo/stats https://mysite.com/path/foo ./docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo/docs/info.html https://mysite.com/path/foo /documents https://mysite.com/documents When I go to relative URL `$relativeURL` relativeURL - A string value of the relative URL. Open main application page and then navigate to '/products/new' page on the application host Given I am on main application page When I go to relative URL `/products/new` Refreshes the page: the step does the same as the reload button in the browser. When I refresh page Checks the page title matches to the text according to the provided string validation rule Then page title $comparisonRule `$text` $comparisonRule - string validation rule. One of: is equal to - title should be equal to text contains - title should contain text does not contain - title should not contain text text - the text of the title to compare Example 15. Validate 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title is equal to `What is VIVIDUS :: VIVIDUS` Example 16. Validate the part of 'https://docs.vividus.dev/' page title Then page title contains `VIVIDUS` Clicks on the element found by the specified locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the element by the locator; click on the element if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; the first two actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is occurred at any atomic action. If element by the specified locator is not clickable (overlapped by another element, problems with page/context loading or the element is disabled) the step will fail with corresponding error: Could not click on the element: org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted: Element Where to Buy is not clickable at point (1619, 275). Other element would receive the click: ... When I click on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 17. Click on element When I click on element located by `name(Submit)` Scrolls the context to an edge When I scroll context to $scrollDirection edge $scrollDirection - the direction of the scroll. One of: LEFT - start of a page/element horizontally RIGHT - end of a page/element horizontally TOP - start of a page/element vertically BOTTOM - end of a page/element vertically If the context is not set, the whole page will be scrolled Example 18. Scroll login to a bottom When I change context to element located by `id(login)` When I scroll context to BOTTOM edge Scrolls an element into the view. When I scroll element located by `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I scroll element located `$locator` into view $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 19. Scroll button into view When I scroll element located by `id(way_down_button)` into view Checks if the page is scrolled to the specific element Then page is scrolled to element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find element. Example 20. Validate Contact link is scrolled into view Then page is scrolled to element located by `xpath(//a[text()=\"Contact\"])` Validates that the text is presented in the current context. Expected text is case sensitive. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text `$text` exists $text - Expected text. Example 21. Check the text 'Contract Us' is presented on the page Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Then text `Contract Us` exists Validates that the text is not presented in the current context. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text `$text` does not exist $text - Text that should not exist. Example 22. Check the text 'Deprecated' is not presented in the element When I change context to element located by `id(code)` Then text `Deprecated` does not exist Validates that the text from current context matches the specified regular expression. The context can be set by the corresponding steps. If no context is set, the text will be searched on the whole page. Then text matches `$regex` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): Then the text matches '$regex' $regex - The regular expression used to validate the text of the context. Example 23. Check the text with pattern 'User \".*\" successfully logged in' is presented in the current context When I change context to element located by `id(code)` Then text matches `User \".*\" successfully logged in` Opens a new browser tab and switches the focus for future commands to this tab. When I open new tab Example 24. Open page in a new tab When I open new tab Given I am on page with URL `https://docs.vividus.dev/` Opens a new tab, switches the focus to this tab and loads the given URL. The key difference of this step from the previous one opening a new tab is that this step inherits the state of the previous page, i.e.: new tab will have acces to the session storage of the previous tab, it will be possible to handle alerts appearing on tab closing. When I open URL `$URL` in new tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I open URL `$URL` in new window $URL - The URL to open. Example 25. Open docs in a new tab When I open URL `https://docs.vividus.dev` in new tab Closes the current tab and switches to the previous tab. When I close current tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I close the current window Handling alerts displayed with 'onbeforeunload' events is not implied by the WebDriver specification to close window. For handling alerts use step based on JavaScript 'Close current tab with possibility to handle alert'. This step can only be applied to a session with multiple tabs open. Example 26. Open URL in new tab, close it and switch to the previous page Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/contact-us` in new tab When I close current tab Trying to close the current tab with 'onbeforeunload' events handling. If an alert window is opened via 'onbeforeunload' event, it must be checked and handled in the subsequent steps. If an alert window is not opened, the step closes the current window and switches to the previous window. When I attempt to close current tab with possibility to handle alert Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I attempt to close current window with possibility to handle alert This step can only be used if the current tab was opened via the step When I open URL `$pageUrl` in new tab. If you confirm window close in alert, the tab will be closed, and you will need to switch to current tab using the following step: When I switch to tab with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName`. Example 27. Checking for an alert when trying to close a window with form Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I open URL `https://example.com/form` in new tab When I click on element located by `xpath(//*[@id='form-edit'])` When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |ENTER_TEXT|changed text| When I attempt to close current tab with possibility to handle alert Then an alert is present When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` Executes the sequence of web actions When I execute sequence of actions: $actions $actions - table of actions to execute Table 3. Possible actions type argument Argument example DOUBLE_CLICK Element locator or empty. By.linkUrl(http://httpbin.org) CLICK_AND_HOLD Element locator or empty. By.linkText(Click me) MOVE_BY_OFFSET Point. (10, 15) where x is 10 and y is 15 RELEASE Element locator or empty. By.tagName(div) ENTER_TEXT Text to type. Minsk City CLICK Element locator or empty.

CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT KEY_UP Comma-separated keys to release one by one. CONTROL,SHIFT,ALT MOVE_TO Element locator. By.id(username) Windows/Unix and macOS platforms have different keyboards. For example, Ctrl+C combination is used to copy text on Windows and Unix, but ⌘ Command+C should be used on macOS with default preferences. In order to close this gap VIVIDUS offers unique key OS_INDEPENDENT_CONTROL: it is mapped to CONTROL key on Windows/Unix and to COMMAND key on macOS. Using this key it is possible to make tests fully platform independent. Example 28. Execute various web-actions When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |DOUBLE_CLICK |By.fieldText(Hello World) | |DOUBLE_CLICK | | |CLICK_AND_HOLD|By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |CLICK_AND_HOLD| | |MOVE_BY_OFFSET|(-300, 0) | |RELEASE |By.xpath(//signature-pad-control/canvas)| |RELEASE | | |ENTER_TEXT |Text | |CLICK |By.placeholder(Enter your password) | |CLICK | | |PRESS_KEYS |BACK_SPACE | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL,SHIFT | |KEY_UP |CONTROL,SHIFT | |MOVE_TO |By.id(name) | This step can be used to perform clipboard interactions. Example 29. Select all text in the focused field and copy it to the clipboard on Windows When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, a| |KEY_UP |a, CONTROL| |KEY_DOWN |CONTROL, c| |KEY_UP |c, CONTROL| Example 30. Paste text from the clipboard to the focused field on MacOS When I execute sequence of actions: |type |argument | |KEY_DOWN |COMMAND, v| |KEY_UP |v, COMMAND| Example 31.

When I switch back to page Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch back to the page Example 37. Switch to user context and back to the default context of page Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/elementState.html` When I change context to element located by `id(button-hide)` Then text `Element to hide` does not exist When I switch back to page Then text `Element to hide` exists Switches to or element using one of the supported locators. When I switch to frame located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to frame located `$locator` $locator - Locator of frame element. Example 38. Switch to frame Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/nestedFrames.html` Then text `Modal Frame Example` does not exist When I switch to frame located by `id(parent)` Then text `Modal Frame Example` exists Switch the focus of future browser commands to new tab. This step gets the identifier of the currently active tab and then switches focus to the first available tab with a different identifier. For example, if tabs #1, #2, #3 are open and tab #2 is active, this step will switch focus to tab #3. A new tab should already be open for this step to function. After executing this step, the new tab will become the active tab. When I switch to new tab Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to a new window Example 39. Open the new tab by link and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows` When I click on element located by `linkUrlPart(/windows/new)` Then text `New Window` does not exist When I switch to new tab Then text `New Window` exists Switch the focus of future browser commands to new tab with specified title. When I switch to tab with title that $stringComparisonRule `$tabName` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I switch to window with title that $stringComparisonRule `$windowName` $stringComparisonRule - String comparison rule. $tabName - The expected tab title. Example 40. Open the new tab by link and switch to it using regex title pattern Given I am on page with URL `https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/windows` When I click on element located by `linkUrlPart(/windows/new)` Then text `New Window` does not exist When I switch to tab with title that matches `.*[wW]indow.*` Then text `New Window` exists Closes the browser. When I close browser Waits for the tab with desired title and switches to it. When I wait `$duration` until tab with title that $comparisonRule `$title` appears and switch to it Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I wait `$duration` until window with title that $comparisonRule `$windowTitile` appears and switch to it $duration - The timeout duration to wait for a tab in ISO-8601 Durations format. $comparisonRule - The tab title comparison rule. $title - The expected tab title. Example 41. Wait for tab and switch to it Given I am on page with URL `https://vividus-test-site-a92k.onrender.com/windows.html` When I click on element located by `id(timeout)` When I wait `PT3S` until tab with title that is equal to `Vividus test site` appears and switch to it Stops page loading When I stop page loading Could be useful in combination with Selenium’s page load strategy Example 42. Stop page loading.story When I open URL `https://delayed.vividus.dev` in new tab When I stop page loading Sets a custom page load timeout for a part of the story When I set page load timeout to `$duration` $duration - total duration to wait for page load completion in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 43. Before loading a heavy page set an increased timeout Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I set page load timeout to `PT20S` When I open URL `https://example.com/super-heavy-page` in new tab When I set page load timeout to `PT10S` Checks web performance metrics. Then metric $webPerformanceMetric is $comparisonRule `$duration` $webPerformanceMetric - The web performance metric. Where: TIME_TO_FIRST_BYTE - The time between the navigation start and the response start. DNS_LOOKUP_TIME - The time between the domain lookup start and the domain lookup end.

Example 44. Check page load Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com` Then metric PAGE_LOAD_TIME is less than `PT5S` Takes a screenshot and publish it to the report. When I take screenshot Takes a screenshot and saves it to the file at the specified path. The full path to the file with the taken screenshot is posted to logs and report. When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `$screenshotFilePath` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I take screenshot and save it to folder `$screenshotFilePath` $screenshotFilePath - The path to the file to save the screenshot, the allowed values are: an absolute path to the file, e.g. C:\\Windows\\screenshot.png; a relative path (it is resolved from the current working directory, e.g. screenshot.png. Example 45. Take a screenshot and save it to the file When I take screenshot and save it to file at path `${screenshot-directory}/start-page.png` Waits for appearance of the element by the locator. It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` appears $locator - Locator. Example 46. Wait for appearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` appears Waits for disappearance of the element by the locator. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). It’s forbidden to use Visibility types in the locator. When I wait until element located by `$locator` disappears $locator - Locator. Example 47. Wait for disappearance of the element with the specified name When I wait until element located by `name(welcome-image)` disappears Waits for an element with the specified state to be found using the specified timeout with polling interval. When I wait `$duration` with `$pollingDuration` polling until element located by `$locator` becomes $state $duration - Total duration to wait in the ISO-8601 format. $pollingDuration - The duration to wait between search retries in the ISO-8601 format. $locator - The locator of the element to wait for state change. $state - The element state. Example 48. Verify that the element become invisible up to 10 times When I wait `PT10S` with `PT1S` polling until element located by `id(element-to-hide)` becomes not visible Waits for the expected number of elements located by locator. In order to wait for invisible elements one rely on Visibility types. When I wait until number of elements located by `$locator` is $comparisonRule $number $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $number - The expected number of the elements. Example 49. Wait for the visible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Example 50. Wait for the invisible elements When I wait until number of elements located by `tagName(img):1` is equal to `5` Waits for element with the specified locator to stop moving. An element is considered moving when its coordinates (position) are changing. For example, an animated GIF is not a moving element unless it changes position. When I wait until element located by `$locator` stops moving $locator - Locator. Example 51. Wait for element with the specified id to stop moving When I wait until element located by `id(submitForm)` stops moving Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the desired number. Then number of elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of the elements. Example 52. Verify the number of elements Then number of elements found by `tagName(img)` is equal to `5` Verifies if the number of elements located by locator matches the number condition and all of them are in the desired state. If you describe number condition as equal to 5 in case if there are 10 elements by this locator and only 5 of them in the desired state. You will get two failed assertions. The first one about number condition violation. The second one about state check failure. In case when Visibility types are used and checked state are equal (For an example ':i' and 'NOT_VISIBLE') exception will be thrown. In such cases please use step: Verify elements number. Contradictory visibility parameters (locator - ':i' and checked state - 'VISIBLE') are also not allowed. Then number of $state elements found by `$locator` is $comparisonRule `$quantity` $state - State $locator - Locator. $comparisonRule - The comparison rule. $quantity - The expected number of elements. Example 53. Verify the number of elements in the state Then number of VISIBLE elements found by `tagName(img)` is = `1` Saves text of an element into a variable. When I save text of element located by `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - Locator. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 54. Save the text of H1 element When I save text of element located by `tagName(h1)` to scenario variable `headingText` Saves the text of the context element into a variable. Step will throw an error if the context element is not set. When I save text of context element to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The name of the variable to save the text. Example 55. Save the text of the context element When I change context to element located by `id(username)` When I save text of context element to SCENARIO variable `username` Saves the attribute value of the context element into a variable.

The actions performed by the step: check the search context is set, search for the element to validate existence (this search may include wait for element appearance if it’s configured), validate the element has presented for the period specified by the duration. Then element located by `$locator` exists for `$duration` duration $locator - The Locator to find an element. $duration - The period of time the element should have existed in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 61. The element should have existed for 5 second Then element located by `id(banner)` exists for `PT5S` duration Waits until an element with the specified locator has text that matches the provided regular expression. When I wait until element located by `$locator` has text matching `$regex` $locator - The Locator of the element which text to check. $regex - The regular expression used to validate the text of the element. Example 62. The element should have text consisting of numbers only When I wait until element located by `id(indicator)` has text matching `\\d+` Navigates back to the previous view. When I navigate back Example 63. Navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `1` When I navigate back Then number of elements found by `xpath(//*[@*='Welcome'])` is equal to `0` Gets a collection of elements by locator and checks that they are sorted by their text in the specified order.

Set focus on the element with ID \"input-username\" When I change context to element located by `id(input-username)` When I set focus on context element Sets the focus on the element found by the specified locator, if it can be focused. The focused element is the element that will receive keyboard and similar events by default. When I set focus on element located by `$locator` $locator - The locator to find an element. Example 82. Set focus on the element with ID \"input-username\" When I set focus on element located by `id(input-username)` Checks if the context element is in the provided focus state by comparing the context element and the active element. Then context element is $focusState $focusState - The state to verify: in focus or not in focus. Example 83. Check the context element is in focus and do keyboard input Then context element is in focus When I press ENTER on keyboard Checks if the element found by the specified locator is in the provided focus state by comparing the found element and the active element Then element located by `$locator` is $focusState $locator - The locator to find an element. $focusState - The state to verify: in focus or not in focus. Example 84. Check the element with ID \"input-username\" is in focus and do keyboard input Then element located by `id(input-username)` is in focus When I change context to element located by `id(input-username)` When I press ENTER on keyboard Fields are elements where users can enter data. The most typical fields are: input, textarea, CKE editor (it usually should be located via body tag, that is contained in a frame as a separate HTML document). Enters the text in a field found by the specified locator. The atomic actions performed are: find the field by the locator; clear the field if it is found, otherwise the whole step is failed and its execution stops; type the text in the field; the first three actions are retried once if the field becomes stale during actions execution in other words if StaleElementReferenceException is thrown at any atomic action. When I enter `$text` in field located by `$locator` $text - The text to enter in the field. $locator - The locator to find a field. Example 85. Add text 'pa$$w0rd' in password field When I enter `pa$$w0rd` in field located by `id(password)` Enters the text in the field found by the specified locator without clearing of the previous content. When I add `$text` to field located by `$locator` $text - The text to add to the field. $locator - The locator used to find field. Example 86. Add text 'name' to username field When I add `name` to field located by `id(username)` Clears the field found by the specified locator. The step does not trigger any keyboard or mouse events on the field. When I clear field located by `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a field. Example 87. Clear username field When I clear field located by `id(username)` Clears the field found by the specified locator using keyboard. The step simulates user action by pressing buttons Ctrl+A and then Backspace that allows to trigger keyboard events on the field. When I clear field located by `$locator` using keyboard $locator - The locator used to find a field. Example 88. Clear password field using keyboard When I clear field located by `id(password)` using keyboard Validates whether the dropdown located by locator exists and contains the list of the expected options.

Validate dropdown contains a set of colors Then dropdown located by `id(colors)` contains options: |state|item | |false|Red | |false|Green| |true |Blue | The item is an option. The state (true or false) specifies whether the item is selected. Verifies if dropdown located by locator exists and first selected option. Then dropdown located by `$locator` exists and selected option is `$option` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): Then dropdown located `$locator` exists and selected option is `$option` $locator - The locator used to find a dropdown. $option - first selected option Example 90. Dropdown.story Then dropdown located by `id(colors)` exists and selected option is `Blue` Selects option in multi-select dropdown Step will fail if target dropdown is not multi-select When I add `$option` to selection in dropdown located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I add `$option` to selection in dropdown located `$locator` $option - option to select $locator - The locator used to find a dropdown. Example 91. Dropdown.story When I add `Two` to selection in dropdown located by `id(numbers)` Selects option in dropdown Does not support multi-selection When I select `$option` in dropdown located by `$locator` Deprecated syntax (will be removed in VIVIDUS 0.7.0): When I select `$option` in dropdown located `$locator` $option - option to select $locator - The locator used to find a dropdown. Example 92. Dropdown.story When I select `Red` in dropdown located by `id(colors)` Validates whether the certain cookie is set. Then cookie with name `$cookieName` is set $cookieName - The name of the cookie to check presence. Example 93. Check the session cookie is present Then cookie with name `JSESSIONID` is set Validates whether the certain cookie is not set. Then cookie with name `$cookieName` is not set $cookieName - The name of the cookie to check absence. Example 94. Check the session cookie is not present Then cookie with name `JSESSIONID` is not set Adds the cookies provided in the input ExamplesTable. It’s allowed to add the cookies for the current domain only: make sure the web browser is opened at the expected domain.

When I set all cookies for current domain:$parameters $parameters - The parameters of the cookies to set as ExamplesTable: Column Name Description cookieName the name of the cookie to set cookieValue the value of the cookie to set path the path of the cookie to set Example 95. Set the cookie for the current domain When I set all cookies for current domain: |cookieName |cookieValue |path | |cookieAgreed |2 |/ | Finds the cookie by the name and saves its value to a variable. When I save value of cookie with name `$cookieName` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of the cookie to save the value. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie value. Example 96. Get the value of the session cookie When I save value of cookie with name `JSESSIONID` to scenario variable `session-id` Finds the cookie by the name and saves all its parameters as JSON to a variable. When I save cookie with name `$cookieName` as JSON to $scopes variable `$variableName` $cookieName - The name of the cookie to save. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie. Example 97. Get the session cookie When I save cookie with name `JSESSIONID` as JSON to scenario variable `session-id` Removes the certain cookie from the current domain. The actions performed by the step: remove the certain cookie the from current domain; refresh the current page (this action is required to apply the changes in cookies). When I remove cookie with name `$cookieName` from current domain $cookieName - The name of the cookie to remove. Example 98. Remove the session cookie When I remove cookie with name `JSESSIONID` from current domain Removes the certain cookie from the current domain, but does not apply the changes in cookies. The current page must be refreshed or the navigation must be performed to apply the cookie changes. When I remove cookie with name `$cookieName` from current domain without applying changes $cookieName - The name of the cookie to remove. Example 99. Remove the session cookie When I remove cookie with name `JSESSIONID` from current domain without applying changes When I refresh page Removes all cookies from the current domain. The actions performed by the step: remove all cookies from the current domain; refresh the current page (this action is required to apply the changes in cookies). When I remove all cookies from current domain Removes all cookies from the current domain, but does not apply the changes in cookies. The current page must be refreshed or the navigation must be performed to apply the cookie changes. When I remove all cookies from current domain without applying changes Finds the web storage item by the key and saves its value to the variable.

The specified browser window size should be smaller than the current screen resolution. When I change window size to `$targetSize` $targetSize - The desired browser window size in pixels, e.g. 800x600, where the first measure is window width, the last one is window height. Example 116. Resize the browser window Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/` When I change window size to `640x320` Steps allow to interact with video elements. Starts video playback. When I play video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Pauses video playback. When I pause video in video player located `$locator` $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Rewinds video to the desired mark in seconds. When I rewind time to `$number` seconds in video player located `$locator` $number - time mark in seconds $locator - The locator used to find a video player. Saves video player info: duration, currentTime, src, networkState. For more information about the properties see HTML Audio/Video Properties When I save info from video player located `$locator` to $scopes variable `$variableName` $locator - The locator used to find video player. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the info. If the variable name is info, the following variables will be created: ${info.src}- The current source of the audio/video element ${info.duration} - The length of the current audio/video (in seconds) ${info.currentTime} - The current playback position in the audio/video(in seconds) ${info.networkState} - The current network state of the audio/video. For more information see: Network State Example 117. Video player verifications Given I am on page with URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYqyVpCV-3c` When I pause video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I rewind time to `777` seconds in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I play video in video player located `cssSelector(video)` When I save info from video player located `cssSelector(video)` to SCENARIO variable `info` Then `${info.currentTime}` is > `0` Then `${info.duration}` is > `1000` Then `${info.networkState}` is = `2` Then `${info.src}` matches `.+youtube.+` Allows to set command line arguments for browsers. This step works similar to the property web.driver..command-line-arguments In case both property and step are used - arguments from property will be ignored. Step will take effect for all new browser sessions created in the current story. It will not affect the current sessions. List of supported command line arguments for popular browsers: . Chrome . Firefox . Internet Explorer Not supported browsers: . Safari . Edge When I set browser command line arguments to `$argsString` $argsString - Sequence of command line arguments, separated by space. Example 118. Set the browser to use the mocked camera stream When I set browser command line arguments to `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream --use-file-for-fake-video-capture=${videoStorage}/${video1}.y4m --use-fake-device-for-media-stream` Given I am on main application page Executes async JavaScript code and saves result into variable. When I execute async javascript `$jsCode` and save result to $scopes variable `$variableName` $jsCode - Any JavaScript code. In order to save a result return statement should be used. $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to save the cookie value. Example 119. Validate response When I execute async javascript ` var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1]; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', '/resource/data.json', true); xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { if (xhr.readyState == 4) { callback(xhr.responseText); } }; xhr.send();` and save result to scenario variable `response` Then `${response}` matcher `.+` Waits for element disappearance with desired timeout. If the element doesn’t exist on the page/context, the step will immediately complete successfully. Checking the element on the page (if needed) should be done in a separate step (e.g. Wait for element appearance or Validate elements). Then element located by `$locator` disappears in `$timeout` $locator - The locator used to element. $timeout - The maximum time to wait for the element disappearance in ISO-8601 Durations format. Example 120. Click on the button and waiting for disappearance of the element for 3 seconds When I click on a button with the name 'Toggle element visibility with delay' Then element located by 'xpath(//div[@id='delayed'])' disappears in 'PT3S' This step allows you to save an HTML table from a specified context into a variable. For more information, see how to work with table variables The HTML table must have a header row with tags. When I save table to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to refer to the variable value. Before using this step, ensure the context is set to the required table. See the example below. Example 121. Save the first table on the page into a variable named 'table' When I change context to element located `xpath(//table[1])` When I save table to SCENARIO variable `table` Saves the number of currently opened tabs in the browser to the variable. When I save number of open tabs to $scopes variable `$variableName` $scopes - The comma-separated set of the variables scopes. $variableName - The variable name to refer to the variable value. Example 122. Save the number of currently opened browser tabs into a variable named 'count' When I save number of open tabs to SCENARIO variable `count` Accepts the action in popup alert with matching text by clicking on the \"OK\" button or dismiss it by clicking \"Cancel\" button. Actions performed at this step: Finds the appropriate alert with matching message Performs the corresponding action When I $alertAction alert with message which $comparisonRule `$message` $alertAction - Action to perform. Possible values: ACCEPT, DISMISS. $comparisonRule - String comparison rule. $message - The text message of the alert. Example 123. Accept popup alert with any text message When I accept alert with message which matches `.*` This step allows you to type text into popup alert input field and then accept the alert. This step is applicable only for alerts with a single input field. For authorization alerts, basic URL authorization should be used. For example, https://user:pass@domain.com When I type text `$text` in alert and accept it $text - The text to be typed into the alert input field. Example 124. Type text 'VIVIDUS' into alert and close it by clicking OK button When I type text `VIVIDUS` in alert and accept it Checks that there is popup alert on the page. Then an alert is present Example 125. Check that an alert appears after clicking on the button When I click on element located by `buttonName(Survey)` Then an alert is present Checks that there is no any popup alerts on the page. Then an alert is not present Example 126. Check that an alert doesn’t appear on the page Given I am on page with URL `http://example.com` Then an alert is not present To validate host component of the current page URL the following statement can be used: Example 127. Validate host component of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `#{extractHostFromUrl(${current-page-url})}` is equal to `example.com` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. To validate path component of the current page URL the following statement can be used: Example 128. Validate path component of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `#{extractPathFromUrl(${current-page-url})}` is equal to `/relative/url/example.html` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. To validate whether current page URL contains some part the following statement can be used: Example 129. Validate part of \"https://example.com/relative/url/example.html\" Given I am on page with URL `https://example.com/relative/url/example.html` Then `${current-page-url}` matches `.+\\/relative\\/url.+` ${current-page-url} is the current page URL dynamic variable. .+\\/relative\\/url.+ is a regular expression to match the expected part of the page URL.","title":"Web

It drives iOS, Android, and Windows apps using the WebDriver protocol. You can run VIVIDUS automated scenarios on mobile devices using Appium tool. Since Appium has a Client/Server Architecture, it is required to install and run Appium server to perform mobile tests. There are two ways of installing Appium server: Application installation (Appium Desktop) Appium Desktop is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any platform. It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server, so you don’t need to worry about Node. Download the latest version of Appium Desktop. Command line installation Appium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed from source or installed directly from NPM: npm install -g appium To run Appium use the command: appium Make sure you have installed: Java Android SDK Xcode (iOS) And the following environment variables are set: JAVA_HOME ANDROID_HOME You can open \"Edit configuration\" to set the variables in Appium Desktop. Read more details for basic Android and iOS setup in Appium Guide. Appium-Doctor diagnoses, reports and fixes common Node, iOS and Android configuration issues before starting Appium. It helps to make sure you have everything to start using Appium. Appium-doctor checks for: Android: Android sdk exists and configured properly; Environment variables and path check; iOS: XCode is installed (with command line tools); Dev tools security check; Auth check; Node binary check; Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and values that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that tell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required capabilities for any Appium driver should include: platformName: the name of the platform to automate platformVersion: the version of the platform to automate deviceName: the kind of device to automate app: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the browserName capability instead in the case of automating a web browser) automationName: the name of the driver you wish to use There are lots of other capabilities. To find out more please see Appium Capabilities Documentation. Before running VIVIDUS scenarios it is necessary to pass Desired Capabilities to Appium Server. Use them as properties with selenium.grid.capabilities. prefix. Then just put these capabilities into the appropriate *.properties file. Please see examples below: Example 1. iOS properties selenium.grid.capabilities.platformName=iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.platformVersion=15.5 selenium.grid.capabilities.deviceName=iPad Pro (9.7-inch) selenium.grid.capabilities.automationName=XCUITest selenium.grid.capabilities.app=/Users/myDirectory/application.ipa Example 2.

See the relevant sections for defining these properties for iOS and Android Appium Inspector is basically just an Appium client with a user interface. It allows to interact with application elements and Appium commands in a user friendly way. You can get the latest version of Inspector application following the link. Click to view capabilities set up in Inspector VIVIDUS Sample Tests is a GitHub repository. Its purpose is to demo VIVIDUS capabilities via sample tests. Let’s use it as an example for running mobile tests via Appium.

Click to view screenshots Appium-Desktop Appium in the terminal Tests execution and expected results Execute the test either via ./gradlew runStories command or by clicking the Run button in the IDE. In case everything has been set up correctly you will see the following: Appium creates a new session; Testing application (Swag Labs Mobile) is installed on the simulator; Application is started; Credentials are entered into username and password fields; After successful login user sees the landing page; Executing tests on real devices has some features and required different preparations depending on the platform. Firstly, make sure you have installed Android Debug Bridge. Simply enter in the command line adb --version. You should get some adb information in the output: adb --version Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41 Version 31.0.3-7562133 Installed as /usr/local/bin/adb Connect the device you want to interact with to your workstation. Use adb devices command to see the list of connected devices: adb devices List of devices attached UKjeCe9Mr9 device In this example UKjeCe9Mr9 is the unique identifier of the device. Use that number as a udid capability (property) in VIVIDUS: selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=UKjeCe9Mr9 You are ready to run tests! Just add this property to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Emulators Automating a real device with XCUITest Driver(iOS) is considerably more complicated, due to Apple’s restrictions around running apps on real devices. XCUITest driver installs a helper application called WebDriverAgent-Runner onto the device, and handles the application under test via it. While this is simple in theory, the hoops of code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can make this a bit of a headache. There are two approaches for WebDriverAgent configuration: Automatic WDA configuration. Proper work of the WDA requires signing it with a valid Apple Developer account. If you have a paid Apple Developer account, please see the following instructions on Appium Doc; Manual WDA configuration. Using a \"Free\" developer account often leads to issues with the impossibility of creating a wildcard provisioning profile for the default application bundle. Follow the instructions below to handle this issue. The next steps are based on Appium manual configuration doc. Add a new Apple Development Certificate for your Apple ID; Click to see details Open Xcode and go to settings Click \"+\" to add an account and then Sign In with your Apple ID Add a new Apple Development Certificate Build WebDriverAgent signed with your newly created certificate; Open WDA project in Xcode; Most common path to the project: /Applications/Appium.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj Come up with your unique Bundle Identifier. Use it for updating build parameters. Click to see details Make sure you’ve chosen correct device and parameters image::appium-check-device-and-parameters.png[] Create your unique BundleId and update build parameters image::appium-update-build-parameters.png[] Build the project Click to see details # iOS selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeSigningId=Apple Development(1) selenium.grid.capabilities.udid=b3f34105281bb345p980p824401d5913f13efe81(2) selenium.grid.capabilities.xcodeOrgId=5H8S64Q9G4(3) selenium.grid.capabilities.updatedWDABundleId=yourUniqueBundleId.WebDriverAgentRunner(4) 1 xcodeSigningId For any Apple device use Apple Development as the xcodeSigningId property. 2 UDID Make sure your Apple device is connected; Open Finder and choose your device; Copy udid from the device information; Click to view screenshots 3 xcodeOrgId Open KeyChain Access application; Go to Default Keychains → Login; Open My Certificates tab and find certificated you have created recently; Open Certificate and use Organisational Unit parameter as xcodeOrgId property; Click to view screenshots 4 updatedWDABundleId Use your unique Bundle Identifier that was created previously as updatedWDABundleId property; When all tools are installed and set up and all desired capabilities are defined, we can start our tests. For the first time, Appium will install the WDA application on the Apple device. Since WDA is signed with an unknown Apple Developer account, we need to add it to the trust. Start the session either via Appium Inspector or by running an autotest. Once the WDA icon appears on the screen, do the following: Go to Settings→General→Profile & Device Management (iOS 15 and higher - Settings→General→VPN & Device Management); Tap on \"Apple Development: \"account name\"; Choose \"Trust\"; Click to view screenshot You are ready to run tests! Just add properties from above to your *.properties file and use the same approach as for Simulators Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Make sure adb sees the device (adb devices). In case the device is not on the list, try restarting adb server via terminal: adb kill-server && \\ adb start-server WDA is expired. This is the most common issue that appeared on iOS devices Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: xcodebuild failed with code 65 When it happens, the icon of the WebDriverAgent disappears from the device menu. To get it back on the device you should rebuild WDA for your device and add your developer account to trust again; Use this guide to fix WDA expiration much faster Make sure that the device is physically connected; Check UDID capability(property). It should match the serial number of the device; Yes. You can create the second application signed with your Apple Developer account. Once WebDriverAgent get expired, it will be deleted. But your second app will remain on the device and keep your Apple Developer account in the trusted list. You will only need to rebuild WDA in a click to get it back. Click to expand steps Make sure your device is connected to your workstation; Open Xcode and create a new project; Choose Application type \"App\" for your platform; Enter Product Name, let’s say \"keeper\"; Use the same Team and Organization Identifier that you used for WebDriverAgent; Click Build; Now your mobile device has the keeper application installed. It will remain on the device even when WDA is deleted due to expiration. When it happens, just connect the device, open the WDA project and click build. After the build is successful you can start your Appium sessions again. Make sure your computer and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-FI network.; On Apple TV go to Settings→Remotes and Devices→Remote App and Devices; On your Mac open Xcode→Window→Devices and Simulators (⌘+2); Click \" + \" on the tab \"Devices\" to add a new device.; Choose your Apple TV from the list; Enter the 6-digit passcode that appeared on the TV screen;","title":"Appium Setup","component":"vividus","version":"latest","name":"appium-setup","url":"/vividus/latest/user-guides/appium-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"Intro","hash":"_intro","id":1},{"text":"Install Appium server","hash":"_install_appium_server","id":2},{"text":"Environment setup","hash":"_environment_setup","id":3},{"text":"Appium-Doctor (Optional)","hash":"_appium_doctor_optional","id":4},{"text":"Appium Capabilities","hash":"_appium_capabilities","id":5},{"text":"Setting capabilities in VIVIDUS","hash":"_setting_capabilities_in_vividus","id":6},{"text":"Basic properties","hash":"_basic_properties","id":7},{"text":"Real devices properties","hash":"_real_devices_properties","id":8},{"text":"Appium Inspector (Optional)","hash":"_appium_inspector_optional","id":9},{"text":"Running tests on Simulator/Emulator","hash":"_running_tests_on_simulatoremulator","id":10},{"text":"Running tests on Real Devices","hash":"_running_tests_on_real_devices","id":11},{"text":"Android","hash":"_android","id":12},{"text":"Android device UDID","hash":"_android_device_udid","id":13},{"text":"iOS","hash":"_ios","id":14},{"text":"WDA configuration","hash":"_wda_configuration","id":15},{"text":"Manual WDA configuration","hash":"_manual_wda_configuration","id":16},{"text":"Define properties for running a real apple device","hash":"_define_properties_for_running_a_real_apple_device","id":17},{"text":"First start","hash":"_first_start","id":18},{"text":"F.A.Q.","hash":"_f_a_q","id":19},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an Android device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_android_device","id":20},{"text":"Why can’t I start the session with an iOS device?","hash":"_why_cant_i_start_the_session_with_an_ios_device","id":21},{"text":"It’s quite unhandy to add an Apple Developer account to trusted every time WDA is expired.
